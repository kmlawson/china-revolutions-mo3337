## Daily Mao Reading

Mao Zedong's speeches and essays have had a huge influence on the political and social discourse of China in the 20th century. More than most national histories, the historian can benefit a lot from a familiarity with his works. At the height of Mao's cult of personality, in the opening years of the cultural revolution, a campaign urged Chinese people to "daily read" (天天读) Mao's works, and a practice of "Ask for instruction in the morning and make a report in the evening" (早请示，晚汇报) encouraged people to rise each morning to read a bit of Mao in order to receive inspiration from him, and later in the evening, read him again and summarize one's achievements of the day. His words were quoted in thousands of publications, often in bolded text to highlight their value, and phrases from his work seeped into daily conversation. 

We will have occasion to discuss in depth some of Mao's most important works, but this semester is a good opportunity to become familiar with a wider range of Maoist discourse through his works and reflect on its broad patterns, tendency for repetition, contradictions and rhetorical techniques, but also changes over time. To this end, students are asked to "Ask for instruction in the morning" and do a bit of "daily reading" of Mao some five days a week for ten weeks of the semester. 

This daily reading should come from two distinct sources and together shouldn't take more than 30 minutes at most: 

- **Each weekday**, read about 10 pages (that is, 5 PDF scanned images) out of 504 pages in total from **[*Selected Readings from the Works of Mao Tsetung*](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/mao/selected-works/mao-selectedreadings-1971.pdf)** (1971) available for [PDF download here](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/mao/selected-works/mao-selectedreadings-1971.pdf). This book is a selection of works from the broader *Selected Works* series. I encourage you to print this out and mark this text up with your notes and highlights.  You can also find and [purchase a used copy of this](https://www.bookfinder.com/search/?st=sr&ac=qr&mode=basic&author=&title=Selected+Readings+from+the+Works+of+Mao+Tsetung&isbn=&lang=en&destination=gb&currency=GBP&binding=*&keywords=&publisher=&min_year=&max_year=&minprice=&maxprice=&classic=off) but look for the 1971 edition. If you want to read the Chinese version, look for the 1966 2nd edition of 《毛泽东著作选读》(甲种本2版) which can be [found online here](http://www.mzdbl.com.cn/maoxuan/%E6%AF%9B%E6%B3%BD%E4%B8%9C%E8%91%97%E4%BD%9C%E9%80%89%E8%AF%BB%EF%BC%88%E7%94%B2%E7%A7%8D%E6%9C%AC%EF%BC%892%E7%89%88.pdf).
- **Each weekday**, read one of the 33 chapters of the **[*Quotations from Chairman Mao Tsetung*](https://muninn.net/modules/mo3337/quotes/)** (1966 edition). I have combined a version of these text available at marxists.org and www.mzdbl.com.cn for use in this class [available online here](https://muninn.net/modules/mo3337/quotes/). Any students learning Chinese can easily switch to the Chinese version of any verse and also hear it read out. If you are only using the English version, again I suggest you print it out and mark it up (there are lots of used copies of the little red book but it has become a bit of a collector item and lots of rubbish versions out there). Most chapters are under 1,000 words, but a few of the chapters are longer (3, 4, 5, 10, 11, 22 and 29) with 1,500-3000 words and you may want to break those into two.


If you want to learn a bit more about the *Selected Readings* and *Quotations* in terms of what they include and exclude, you may be interested in this post: [Swimming in the Sea of Mao’s Works](https://froginawell.net/frog/2024/08/a-few-notes-on-works-by-mao/). For more on the *Quotations* I recommend the opening chapters of *Mao's Little Red Book: a Global History* ([Ebook](https://library.st-andrews.ac.uk/record=b3053036~S5)).

**Things to Note, Things to Ask**

- Highlight and keep a note file where you record key terms that keep appearing throughout Mao's texts. What special meanings do they take on in Mao's language? E.g. does liberalism or democracy mean what you might think they mean?
- What passages in his texts touch on themes of violence or may be particularly useful in a violent campaign? How does he justify or limit legitimate violence?
- What passages seem to support a diversity or range of opinions on policies? What passages might be used to crush dissent?
- *Selected Readings* 
    - Keep an eye on the shift in frequency of mention of particular themes or terms over time
    - When Mao appeals to a source for authority or legitimacy, what figures or kinds of texts does he appeal to?
    - Mao likes facts, objectivity and being practical, but how specific or abstract are different pieces that he writes? When is he more abstract and when is he more concrete?
    - Mao loves on the one hand but on the other constructions of dialectical reasoning. Find examples of this in his writing: what impact do you think it has in practice for revolutionary politics?
- *Quotations*
    - As you read, you will start to recognize the quotations from the texts you have already read in *Selected Readings* but taken out of their original context. What gets lost when they have been pulled out of their context? What can we learn from the way they have been assembled in groupings in the *Quotations*?
    - How might some of these quotations find their way into daily life? How might you use them?
    - Plucking out phrases from the quotations, how might they be used for purposes that they were not intended? Can Mao's quotes be useful in a struggle against Mao or the Chinese state?
