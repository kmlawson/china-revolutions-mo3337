# Assignments

The **summative** assessed portion of the coursework for this module consists of **one long essay**, one **ten minute presentation**, and four **reading analysis posts**. There are several **formative** assessments, most of which are required to pass the module, but do not receive a grade. These include a **essay prospectus**, **map quiz**, **two event quizzes**, a **formative presentation** (optional), essay outline, and three elective reading handouts.

**Note:** Paper submissions are not requested for any of the assessments. You may upload the submissions directly onto MMS. Formative assessments are often shared on Teams for everyone.  

### Headers and Formatting

At the top of all your written work or on a **cover page**, you are required to include the following:

* Date: The date of submission
* Assignment: The assignment you are submitting (e.g. Long Essay, etc.)
* Student Number
* Title: A *specific title* (not the assignment type) for your essay in the case of the Prospectus and Long Essay
* Word Count: The total number of words (use the word count feature of your word processor, including footnotes)

When formatting your assignments, you are required to follow these guidelines:

* Page numbers are required
* Use a minimum of 12 sized font

Other aspects of formatting are highlighted in the School of History style sheet. See the following section.

### Footnotes and Bibliography

Long essays must use footnotes and a bibliography. Reading analysis posts can use simple parenthetical citation with no bibliogrpahy. Please carefully read the St Andrews School of History Style Sheet:

[School of History Style Sheet](https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/assets/university/schools/school-of-history/documents/current-students/school-of-history-style-guidelines.docx)

This document, sections 1-4, contains extremely valuable information on how to compose your essay, including how to format your footnotes and bibliography. In particular, please follow the instructions for footnotes carefully. Note: reading analysis posts do not need a bibliography (see below).

In your bibliography, please have separate sections for your secondary sources and the primary sources you used.

If you prefer **and do so consistently**, you may use the Chicago Style (Notes and Bibliography) over the St Andrews note formatting. I encourage you to manage your sources in a referencing tool such as [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/) which can also helpfully save citations from various web databases and libraries.

## Ten Minute Presentation {#presentation}

**20% Presentation Recorded with Slides or In-person with Handout**

Being able to synthesise reading and present ideas orally in class is a key skill and you will have opportunities to improve this skill during the semester in four ways: 1) You will be formally assessed on **one presentation**. 2) If you are presenting in Week 3-11, you may submit a **recorded formative presentation** to get some early feedback on your presentation skills in an office hour meeting. 3) In addition, in any given week, if asked, you should be prepared to speak to the class for 3-4 minutes about the elective reading you have signed up for that week. You should be able to introduce the reading to other students who may not have read the reading, and articulate its main contributions to the week's themes in a concise manner. If you are uncomfortable with being called on in this way about elective readings, please get in touch so we can discuss other options. 4) You will often be asked to discuss readings and questions in groups.

Sign-ups for **in-person** presentations are in Week 0-1 and are usually limited to one per week. Other presentations not in-person are recorded submissions, generally limited to one per week. **In-person presentations require a handout but should not have slides. Recorded presentations have slides, but no handout.** Slides or handout should be submitted to MMS by the day before your presentation as well as shared on Teams for everyone. Recorded presentations must be uploaded to the team **at least 48 hours** before our class begins so everyone has a chance to watch it. See the content session below for information about what to present on.

**Recorded Presentation** 

The recorded presentation has slides but no handout. Record your voice over slides in Apple Keynote, in Powerpoint, or some other application, **but this must export the result as a movie file** for sharing with your teammates - you may not submit a powerpoint or keynote file and it should be a standalone video file that you share with the class via Teams (you can upload the simple slides or exported PDF of slides to MMS). You must submit the video *at least 48 hours before the class* related to the content, or you will receive a late penalty for each day as if it were an essay submitted late. A strong first class recorded presentation will not have very text heavy slides, will have an excellent connection between visual, textual, content and linking of slide content and spoken word, and will be delivered in a dynamic manner. 

- IMPORTANT: You must submit a movie to teams for sharing with the class - *not a powerpoint file with embedded sound, and not a keynote file*, but a movie file. Again: you must submit a movie file (MP4, etc.). The MMS upload can be a pdf or slides file.
- Confirm that your movie can be viewed using the open source software [VLC](https://www.videolan.org/). 
- After saving as a movie file, please confirm that voice is clearly audible (not a faint or unclear voice) and your slides display. 
- The recorded presentation video should be uploaded to the class files in Microsoft Teams no later than 48 hours before the class relevant to the content which lists the book as an option. No handout for the recorded presentation.
- Please name the video file you upload strictly following this format: the week number, your first name, "Presentation", and a title of the text your presentation is about. For example: "W5 - Sarah Presentation - The Book Title"
- Consider making good use of visual images, and try to keep the amount of text on screen, except for cases of an important quote, to a minimum. 
- Recorded presentations assess a slightly different set of skills than the in person presentation: they are a good way to practice and improve your ability combine images with your voiced narration and a small amount of text on screen. More time is required to prepare a recorded presentation, but you have the advantage of being able to re-record sections you are unhappy with. More time is required to find effective visual material and evaluate the amount of textual material you will present to supplement your voice, but you don't need to worry about either the handout or responding to questions.
- if a recorded presentation with slides, make effective use of images, show restraint in the use of text, generally slides that are merely a list of bullet points (in other words, don't do what lecturers often do at St Andrews!). 

**In-Person Presentation**

We will have a limited number of slots during the semester for in-person presentations, first come, first serve via sign-up list on Week 0-1. You are expected to produce a supplementary handout (single side of a single page) and answer one or two questions directed at you after your presentation. A strong first class live dissertation will *not be read from an exact transcript*, nor will it reproduce exactly content from any handout bullet points: it will be well-practiced, clearly articulated, show good eye contact with other students (not the tutor), and is never rushed.

- Use the handout to indicate the overall structure of your presentation and key points you will make. You may include some basic names, events, or places of importance, or any key quotes.
- The handout should be shared via the Team by the beginning of class to the appropriate folder and be named strictly as follows: the week number, your first name, and a title of the text your presentation is about. For example: "W5 - Sarah - The Book Title"

**Presentation Content** 

Unless you secure permission for a special topic from me, the topic of your presentation should be a *single author* monograph (not an edited volume of different chapters) from among those approved for the given week of your presentation. Throughout the seminar readings provided below you will see a (P) next to appropriate texts you may present on (don't forget to check the further reading for options). If the work is in the required or elective reading section, however, **your presentation should cover the entirety of the work**, not merely any assigned chapters. 

Because you are presenting on the work *as a whole* the presentation assessment, it is impossible to cover everything. You can tell us what aspects of the book you will focus on and which ones you will say little or nothing about based on their importance overall. You must have read to book as a whole, however, to know what is important or not important to present. This presentation will evaluate your demonstration of your ability to: 

- choose what is most useful to share: a very concise sentence or two of author background, the key arguments in the work, main cases it considers, strengths and weaknesses, links to other reading of the week when relevant
- include illustrative examples that give the listener a feel for the work
- project your voice clearly, make use of effective pauses, modulate your voice effectively
- make use of a spoken rather than a written register that engages the listener
- avoid exactly reproducing the content of a handout and don't sound like you are using bullet points
- try to avoid the *appearance of reading* from a script - first class in-person presentations do not come across as read presentations

The assessed presentation should be 10 minutes in length *and not a minute longer*. Being slightly under the time limit is fine. Better to say too little in what is within the time limit and not rushed, than a rushed completion or over time. The presentation should summarise the main arguments, point out what was most interesting or useful as a takeaway from the chosen text, and include at least some consideration of your critical evaluation: discuss at least one limitation or shortcoming. This should be substantive, based on an evaluation of concrete content, not superficial or based on your own enjoyement of the text (avoid "it was too long", "it was boring", "it was too theoretical", etc.). It should *not* a detailed and exhaustive retelling of the content: it should set the context, highlight the arguments, strengths, contributions, and offer an evaluation. Nor is your goal to determine whether or not you can "recommend" that someone should read a book. Part (but not all) of the presentation may offer greater detail on a particularly important section. 

\pagebreak

**What Ifs**

If you have signed up for an in person presentation and you are sick or otherwise unable to attend your presentation, contact Konrad. Make-up presentations will be in the form of a recorded presentation. If you submit a recorded presentation late (that is, later than 48 hours before class to both MMS and Teams), you will receive the standard -1 per day it is late until it is submitted.

*Some questions I consider when marking the presentations:*

* Did the student project their voice clearly, modulate their voice appropriately, make effective use of pauses
* Did the student speak at an appropriate pace and not overload their presentation with too much content?
* Did the student appear to move beyond simply reading a written document?
* Did the distributed handout accurately summarize the general points to be made in the presentation in the form of concise bullet points?
* Did the handout include any important dates, sources, key people, or, if necessary, a map that serves as a useful reference?
* Was the time minute limit very strictly observed in the presentation?
* Did the presentation provide the context of the work, and very briefly introduce the author without this taking up too much time?
* Was the presentation well-structured, organized, and focus on a only a few key points in depth?
* Was there a good balance of arguments, examples to support them, and critique?
* Did the presentation avoid being a presentation of a series of bullet-point style facts?
* Did the presentation make an effort to connect the readings to other readings for the day or find ways to connect to the reading and discussion from previous weeks?

#### Formative Presentation {#formativepres}

Presentations can be a stressful assessment for some students and practice helps. Any student who has signed up for a presentation from Week 3-11 may submit a recording of a 3-4 minute presentation focused on one of our required or elective readings (just an article or a chapter is fine from within the assigned material of any kind) and book an office hour to get feedback on this presentation and suggestions for their assessed presentation. Keep in mind you will need to share this on the team in the folder labeled as such at least a full day before office hours to leave time for your tutor to watch it and be able to give live feedback.

## Reading Analysis Posts {#posts}

**20% Four posts shared on Teams and then Final MMS Upload of Four Chosen Posts Friday, Week 10, 5pm**

20% of the grade for this module comes from **four reading analysis posts** your write in response to weekly reading. Together the final submitted version should amount to no more than 2,500 words (usual 10% rule for penalties) across four posts. Your reading analysis posts must be shared on Teams **in four separate weeks of the semester at least 24 hours before the relevant class** in the Teams channel for the appropriate week.** Please name your shared Teams post strictly following this format: the week number, your first name, "Post", and a title for your post. For example: "W5 - Yoshiko Post - [title for the post]" These are shared initially on Teams so we can all read them and potentially work them into our seminar discussion. This also ensures that these posts are being written throughout the semester, and not by the final deadline. For example, if you are writing one reading analysis post about readings for our Week 3 session, you must share the post a full day before our meeting in Week 3. If you like, you may choose to submit one post any time in independent learning week (Week 6) related to any week you like. You may submit a post for Week 11 in Week 10 (even if you have already submitted a post that week). When you post to Teams, **do not post a file**, just paste in your post text and post it directly to Teams. Then, in Week 10 (or any time after you have completed four posts), choose four of your posts, put them together into a **single document** for MMS re-submission, including the following for each post:

- each post title in bold
- date post was originally shared on teams and the week number
- a link to the post on teams (find your old post and "copy link" from the menu at top right of your post)
- word count of the post
- the content of the post pasted in.

You will receive a summative mark for these only after final submission of all posts, but you are welcome to come to office hours to ask for oral feedback on your first or second post. I strongly urge you to get most or all of these out of the way quickly, ideally by Week 6 or Week 7 so you can focus your energies on essay research and writing. 

**Special Offer:** Some students are uncomfortable about the fact that the posts and the essay are both submitted late in the semester. This means that two major summative grades are provided near the end of the module. The logic behind this is that these are *summative* assessments, which build on your *formative* work during the semester that you can iterate and improve upon. This is why you have the option to write more posts than you submit - you may come to office hours to get feedback on one or more posts and suggestions for improvement. However, students are welcome to complete and submit all their posts by the end of Week 6 to MMS, and they may receive their mark unofficially in week seven or eight. They may not resubmit the posts after this time, however, and must accept that mark.

**Reflective Posts - What to Write:**

- You can focus on one or more required readings (including primary sources - which I encourage you to engage with) and/or your elective reading. 
- If you are also submitting a handout on this week (which you are free to do), you should not have the handout and the post be on the same text.
- I recommend that your post make a single clear argument about your reading/s, backed with evidence and several examples from one or ideally several of the texts
- Posts that put the week's readings in conversation with each other or connect to previous weeks are most welcome, but to the end of a single overarching point.
- Please make **at least one explicit reference to a specific part of a source, but ideally your post will have several**. You do not need formal footnotes or bibliography! Instead, mention the title clearly in the body of your post or else make it clear from context which of the week's readings you are referring to, and (you must) include relevant page number references in parentheses. 
- Your posts should ideally each aim to be between 500-700 words each (remember all of them together should add up to 2,500)
- The posts should have a single overarching purpose and unified focus - if you find your post getting too long ask yourself if you have remained focused throughout. Do one thing well: think of the post as a mini-essay.
- Avoid vague references to what you like and don't like; what you found interesting or not interesting - again: use these posts as a place to practice the making and supporting of arguments about your reading.
- Be concise and avoid repetition. 

**Note:** Many, perhaps most, of you will only write four posts to share on Teams that are eventually submitted. However, you are free to write posts to share on Teams in as many weeks as you like (only one post per week) but you may **only submit four of them in Week 11 on MMS**. You may make minor editorial changes (corrections to language etc.) on the MMS submitted version, but may not make them longer or substantively change the content. However, you may make them shorter or more concise by cutting material, if you like. 

## Elective Reading Handouts {#handouts}

**Three Handouts Shared on Teams Channel 24 Hours before Relevant Class**

During the semester, you are required to submit at least **three elective reading handouts**. You may submit no more than one handout per week but you may choose the weeks. I strongly encourage you to get this done early in the semester. These are not marked, but submission of three of them is required to pass the module. Each week on Teams, **at least 24 hours before our class meeting**, you can upload a reading handout as a pdf odt, rtf, docx, or txt file to the "Files" for the channel of the week. The handout should be **two pages** and provide general info about the elective reading you chose. At the top, write 2-4 sentences which summarizes the text/s in your own words, including any main argument of the work/s. On the rest of the two page should include information you think is most important on the structure of the text/s, timeline, main sources used, key historiography engaged with, people or description of events discussed, and your own main takeaway points. You may make use of bullet points, lists, outlines, etc. Please name your handout strictly following this format: the week number, your first name, "Handout", the category of elective reading and category title. For example: "W5 - Henrik Handout - C [name of elective reading category]" 

- These are required submissions but not marked. 
- The whole thing may be in the form of hierarchical bullet points if you like, but make most of these full sentences whenever possible, rather than fragmented phrases except when outlining structure or listing things. 
- you should include at least some specific reference to arguments or passages in the text, with page number references in simple parenthesis, e.g. (24) 
- No smaller than size 10 font. No need for images
- When you do your elective reading handout on a text, you are expected to have good notes on that text, and you should review these before seminar. You may be called upon in class to briefly summarise the text, or answer questions about the work. 

## Prospectus and Indicative Bibliography {#prospectus}

**abstract, overview, and bibliography of a minimum of 12 secondary sources for your long essay due Monday Week 7 5pm**

You are required to submit a 500 word prospectus, a proposal or abstract for your long essay, including a draft articulation of a possible argument and an indicative bibliography (the latter not included in word count). You are also **strongly encouraged** to come to office hours to discuss a draft of this you will have an opportunity to submit earlier. 

**Prospectus** (500 Words): Write a brief summary of your essay **as if you have already written it**. What did it do (in the past tense)? What kinds of sources did you use? How did you structure the essay? Include in this 500 words a sentence in **bold** which is a statement of the essay's proposed argument. At this early stage of your research, this is highly speculative, and it is very unlikely to end up being the actual argument you will make in your essay. Your eventual final argument will also likely be much more concrete than it is here in the prospectus but use this as an opportunity to practice stating a possible argument you will make.   

**Indicative Bibliography**: Divided into two sections, primary and secondary sources, offer a list of sources that you will have access to in a language you can read that you think will be useful for your essay based on your reading so far. For each source, include one complete sentence explaining why you think the source is useful. List no fewer than 12 secondary sources and no more than 30 (for this exercise). Sources should not merely be limited to those directly on the topic, but "climb up the ladder of abstraction" to include important works on the more general topic you can learn from. 

## Map Quiz {#maps}

In Week 2 there will be a formative map quiz (required but not graded). To prepare for this review the interactive [map online here](https://muninn.net/modules/mo3337/map/). You will be given a map and asked to label as many of the provinces and key cities you can. You will also be asked to draw the courses of the Yellow river and the Yangzi. The quiz will be peer graded. Results will be tracked on semester leaderboard. There may be prizes.

## Event Quizzes {#events}

There will be two event Quizzes, in Week 3 and Week 5. The first of these will be on the "China Timeline 1830s-1989" set of events which you can [review directly online here](https://muninn.net/modules/mo3337/flash/). The second event quiz will be on one of the supplemental event lists of your chosing (there are "small" and "large" packets, the in-class quiz will be based on the small packets). By the second week you should [choose one of the main periods covered by the module](#eras) which will determine which set of events you will be quizzed on for the second quiz. Results will be tracked on semester leaderboard. There may be prizes.

## Long Essay {#longessay}

The 4,000 word essay (including footnotes) for the course is worth 60% of the total coursework. This is the heart of your efforts during the semester. It may be up to 5,000 words without penalty (as opposed to the penalty starting at 10% limit over 4,400). Penalties for longer essays are then are as normal. 5,001 words receives a -1 penalty, and 5,401 a -2 penalty, 5,801 a -3 penalty and so on. Don't assume a longer essay is better. 

**This is not an essay you research and compose in the final weeks of the semester.** This essay requires you to make progress on it **throughout the semester**. Again: **You must set aside several hours every week to work on this essay**. Narrow down an area of interest, read within this area of interest, isolate a few themes of interest, carry out further reading and analysis, and then proceed to write an essay which makes a convincing historical argument. 

Some class time in most weeks will be dedicated to discussing the essay. It is not uncommon for a student to change topics once or twice during the semester, as the feasibility of one topic or another is evaluated and the sources explored. I don't recommend bigger topic changes after Week 7. My suggestion is that you answer two questions for yourself very early in your research: 1) Once you have a general topic or area of history you are interested in, think about what kinds of arguments or historical approaches have been applied to this area before that will serve as the starting point for your intervention? 2) What kinds of primary sources do you have realistic access to for use in the essay. Most first class essays will show an ability to carry out original research that includes use and analysis of **primary sources**, but students may choose to do a historiographical essay instead. It is harder, but by no means impossible, to meet the first class grade descriptors for a historiographical essay.

### Topics for the Essay {#eras}

Your essay should be an **argument driven** analytic research essay and a first class essay will engage extensively with primary sources. The title should aim to be similar to that of an academic article. Academic articles rarely have questions in their title and instead suggest the topic, scope, and argument that the reader will find in the essay. You should write your essay on a topic which falls within the scope of one of the following periods:

- Late Qing dynasty history (1790s onwards)
- China during the Republic (1911-1945)
- China during the second Sino-Japanese War (1937-1945)
- The rise of the CCP and the Chinese Civil War (1921-1949)
- China during the Maoist period and thereafter but only up to 1989 (1949-1989)

Please choose one of these eras to focus on by the second week. That will also determine the supplemental event list for your second quiz.

*Journals for Inspiration:* I would suggest browsing some of the following journals, and especially note articles that fit the above description:

*The Journal of Asian Studies*  
*China Quarterly*
*Late Imperial China*
*Harvard Journal of Asiatic Studies*  
*Twentieth-Century China*
*Modern China*
*Journal of Modern Chinese History*  
*Modern Asian Studies*  
*Critical Asian Studies*  
*positions: east asia cultures critique*   
*Asian Studies Review*
*Chinese Historical Review*
*Chinese Studies in History*
*Bulletin of Concerned Asian Scholars*
*British Journal of Chinese Studies*
*China Heritage*
*China Perspectives*
*Saksaha: A Journal of Manchu Studies*

### Making an Argument

The academic study of history embraces change in the past as a way to explore solutions to particular problems. The object of an analytical historical research essay is not to tell us simply what happened, but to use what happened in order to make a historical argument about some problem clearly defined. For example, if an essay was written (to take an example from Chinese history) about some aspect of the religious aspects of the Boxer Uprising, it should not consider its task complete when the major facts of the Boxer Uprising and its religious elements have been retold. That is closer to the genre of the encyclopaedia entry than of academic historical study. It should endeavour to use the Boxer Uprising as an opportunity to  make an argument about something: what does the rebellion reveal about the nature of Western imperialism? The rise of new religious movements in China? The weakness of the late Qing state? The rise of Japan? The answer takes the form of a claim that does more than merely repeat a synthesis of what previous scholarship has established and agrees to be the case. The possibilities are many, but in every case, they offer an answer to the question: So what? History can and should tell stories, but a research essay embeds a story within an arc of an argument - if it contains narrative elements, it must also always include an analytic element.

The historical argument in your long essays, in particular, should be clearly and unambiguously stated in the span of 1-3 sentences somewhere in the opening third of the essay, preferably in the opening paragraph or two. It should not be obvious, trivial, or a well-known and rarely contested fact. Challenging as false an existing historian's argument that has become considered obvious and rarely contested, however, is one ambitious way to find your way to an interesting and original argument but only if your evidence is sufficient. Alternatively, if you have found evidence that supports the existing arguments of historians in a given area of research in a new set of sources, from a fresh perspective, or in greater depth, or in a comparative light, that also often yields a strong argument. If you have identified a debate in the historiography and wish to take a position on it without simply repeating all of the points made by one of the participants of the debate, that can also yield an essay with a strong argument but you should take care to acknowledge the position and evidence of the other side.

**Presenting your Argument:** There are a number of different ways to write a strong essay and present the argument, but in this module, I would like to strongly encourage you to "front-load" your argument and do so clearly, that is, to present clearly early in the essay what it is you will argue and why it is important. For example, avoid sentences such as "I will explain..." or "I aim to understand..." or "I will explore..." unless such sentences are immediately followed by the explanation, what you ended up understanding, or what the result of your exploration was. Otherwise, there is a danger that your essay will merely provide a summary of some quantity of information you have found, rather than present the results of your analysis of that research in a useful way. In other words, do not use the introduction to make predictions about what you will do, but tell the reader in very clear terms what you **have argued and shown** in the essay. There are many ways to do this in more or less subtle language but there is no harm in a very clear, **"In this essay, I will argue that..."** followed by the rest of your argument, a short overview of what kinds of evidence you will use, how your argument fits into a historiographical context (how your argument relates to what other historians have to say about the matter), and why you think it is important.

**Sticking to your Argument:** All of us come across many interesting stories, anecdotes, and sub-points that we want to share in writing our essays. However, it is important to **stay sharply focused on the main argument** you are going to make in the essay. After you have finished writing your essay, read it through and for each paragraph and sentence ask yourself if it supported your argument, provided essential background to establishing your argument, or else if it does not offer much of a contribution. If it doesn't, cut it ruthlessly from your essay to make room for better material.

Engaging with the historiography: What does this phrase mean? It means directly and explicitly acknowledging what historians have said about your topic and your specific question in existing work. Point out both positive contributions and problematic ones when appropriate. Who has worked on this before, and what specifically have they argued? See your essay as part of a larger conversation (it doesn't necessarily have to be an adversarial one) that includes previous historians. Once you have considered those who have done research very close to your case or argument, also engage with the important historiography in the broader field most relevant to your topic.

Some other questions to ask yourself as you write the long essay:

* Does the essay have a clear introduction which articulates the argument I wish to make in the essay? Does it move beyond telling the reader what the essay is "about" and what the essay "will do" to tell the reader very clearly what *has been accomplished* in the essay and *what be specifically shown* in the essay, and not leave this only for the conclusion?
* Does the essay have a clear conclusion which restates the main points and then makes some effort to contextualise the findings in the broader issues of the course?
* Does the essay situate the argument being made in the context of the sources used, and its relevance to the study of our module topic?
* Does the essay show a good understanding of the sources used, and use them effectively in supporting my argument with clear and specific examples to enforce my points?
* Does the essay avoid long quotations from secondary works whenever possible? Do I instead summarise, without plagiarising, and cite the work of secondary work except when the particular wording or language is key to the argument I wish to make?
* Have I cited with footnotes all claims that are not a well-known and general historical fact.
* Have I used a variety of appropriate sources to provide evidence in support of my claims?
* Have I avoided using phrases like "many historians argue" or "much scholarship" or "it is often argued" and offer specific examples and citations?
* Does the essay retain a strong focus on the main argument, and avoid passages which stray significantly from the main points?
* Does the essay avoid being a summary or introduction to a particular topic, event, or person in order to make a clear argument that is falsifiable?
* Have I gone back and considered my major claims from a critical perspective, and answered any major possible weaknesses in my essay?
* Is my argument non-trivial? That is, does it go beyond a well-known historical consensus about a topic?
* Has the long essay engaged with the historiography on the relevant issue effectively throughout?
* Does the essay consider alternative explanations, acknowledge inconvenient facts, and point out sources or historians who may have differing approaches?
* Did I proofread my essay, check the spelling, and reread for sentences that are unclear? Did I avoid using imprecise or abstract terms when concrete ones would suit better?
* Did I carefully follow the style guide for the School of History for all my footnotes?
* Did I include a bibliography at the end of my essay and is it formatted according to the School of History style guide? Does it have separate sections for primary and secondary sources?
* Have I avoided using websites and newspaper articles not by academic authors to support my claims when there are good academic historical scholarship (in monograph, journal article, or online published forms)
* Have I taken care that the introduction, historiography and any background does not take up too much of the entire length of the essay (less than 25%, usually)
* Did I include a word count in the header and followed the other header guidelines?

### Carrying Out Research for Essays

**Secondary to Primary**: When you have selected a question or broader topic for your longer essay the first, one common approach is to look for information on the topic among the various books and articles that are assigned or proposed in this course, especially the further reading of each week. This is the "secondary to primary" approach. Early on, it is useful to focus on skimming through sources as you find them, noting carefully works of potential interest found in the footnotes or bibliographies of these works to help you broaden and then later focus in your research. "Scrape" the bibliography and footnotes of more general works in your area of interest, look those works up and then "scrape" the bibliography/footnotes of those works (move between recent books/articles and older ones to try to fill out your search better). Eventually you will get a broader shape of the landscape of research around your topic. Along the way you will get the feel for what the key works are, but also what more general works "up the ladder of abstraction" are often cited that influence the writers or help them establish basic categories and concepts. You hopefully also get an impression for what kinds of primary sources have been used in the past, or at least categories of sources that may be useful. Then dive into the primary sources, either those which you have found through the secondary scholarship, or which may have been neglected by it but which has potentially something to contribute.

**Primary then Secondary**: Other students and scholars argue that you should avoid reading closely related secondary research on a topic in the first stage (beyond very general background), but instead directly dive into a set of relevant primary sources. Reading these, they look for things that stand out or which surprise or shock them, then they return to the secondary scholarship. If your initial ideas and reading end up not working out and you need to pivot during the semester, this is often a great way to do it: instead of starting the process above from scratch, find a rich body of primary sources and dive deep with them. Even with time lost on one idea, some of the best essays I have read have emerged from a student who has read deeply on some initial topic, started over, and this time tried things the other way around, starting with a single collection of interesting historical primary sources. 

Whichever of these general approaches you take, in reality all students and scholars will need to move back and forth multiple times between primary and secondary sources as they refine their research questions and their proposed arguments.

When you do not find enough through the above method of beginning your trail with our existing assigned works and module handbook bibliography, proceed to search in various databases for relevant keywords:

* The secondary bibliography at the end of this handbook
* The primary sources at the end of this handbook
* Our library catalogue
* Major journal databases we have access to such as JSTOR and MUSE
* Google Scholar (scholar.google.com) which can then direct you to other journals our library may provide access to
* Google Books and The Internet Archive (archive.org)
* Consult with librarians - they are your friend. Bring them what you have found already and work with them to find further resources.
* LLMs - Large Language Models such as ChatGPT are highly problematic tools given their propensity to confidently manufacture completely false information, but may be useful as *one early part* of your brainstorming process. See my separate document on the LLM policy for this module.
* Learn to use Google more effectively:
    * Search for phrases in quotation marks " " when appropriate
    * Try adding filetype:pdf to limit results to PDF files

The long essays should use at least a dozen secondary sources which are not websites and the inclusion of several primary sources (their number depends very much on what you are doing with them) is strongly encouraged. An essay based on sources that are the results of a simple google search can be written in an evening of frantic last minute work, but rarely demonstrates much effort, research skill, or ability to isolate high-quality materials to support an argument. This is not because there are not excellent websites with overviews on a topic, excellent wikipedia entries, etc. but because there is still usually far greater quality material found in published articles and books on most historical topics, including those which are assigned above. It is wise to make use of online research skills to get oriented in a new topic, but use this course as an opportunity to explore the wealth of academic research on your topics. Your essays will be assessed, in part, on how effectively your sources demonstrate your research efforts. Of course, digitized primary (archival sources, documents) or secondary sources (e.g. articles in academic databases) found in digital collection are permitted and an online source or two in addition to your other sources beyond the minimum is fine if chosen carefully for quality.

The process described above of "scraping" footnotes and bibliographies is a stage which requires only rapid skimming and brisk movement across a large number of candidate materials. This might be combined with a closer reading of a good general work. Once you have a good body of secondary sources, you can return to works previously skimmed and read in a more informed targeted way. In researching for an essay you rarely have to read an entire work, and even when you do so, you should skim less relevant sections. Unlike reading for pleasure, historical research involves reading as a hunt for answers to problems. If you find that your argument does not hold or has insufficient evidence to support it, zoom out again and restart the process. This circular movement is one very effective approach to historical research. Start broad, find potential key arguments and inspiring ideas. Moving quickly, test these ideas and arguments by searching in other sources and zooming into detailed cases and examples. If this doesn't work or is insufficient, zoom out again and repeat. Once you are happy with an argument and the available evidence, then read more slowly and with determination, taking more detailed notes, and outlining your essay as you go.

**The Worst Possible Way to Proceed:** Perhaps the worst possible way to do research for your essay is to find a dozen or two works on your broad topic by title search. This usually results in you finding several very general and introductory works on your topic. Allow this collection of books and articles to rest comfortably on your shelf until the deadline nears, and then sit down and attempt to read all these works and hope that your essay will emerge from the vast knowledge you have gained in reading these books.

#### Inter-library Loan, NSL and SCONUL

Our library has a fair number of works related to our topic but still is missing many texts that will be of great use to many students in their research. Two resources that you should become aware of early on for honours level historical reseearch, if you aren't already are inter-library loan and SCONUL. Effective use of these two resources depend on you establishing your research topic early in the semester to allow for the time it takes to obtain the relevant materials, when they are not at St Andrews. The library can request materials that are in the holdings of other libraries in the UK and Europe, and sometimes beyond, and give you permission to either check out or access within the library itself those materials, for a limited time. UK requests can sometimes arrive within a week, but from farther afield, may take several weeks. To make an inter-library loan request, visit the relevant library resources page:

SCONUL is a library scheme that helps you get direct access to other libraries. There are particularly rich East Asia collections at many libraries in the UK, including Edinburgh, Leeds, Manchester, Birmingham, SOAS in London, Cambridge, Oxford, and others. In other cases, libraries in Glasgow, Aberdeen, and elsewhere may not have as strong of an East Asia collection, but possess interesting primary sources with connections to East Asia that may serve well for a long essay. If you know there is a significant collection of materials, especially primary source collections or special collection, you may apply for SCONUL access to use these materials, but it can take a bit of time. Read more and apply here:

Finally, the National Library of Scotland in Edinburgh is a fantastic library that has very rich collections of both secondary sources (as one of the legal deposit libraries in the UK) and rich primary source collection. You can join for free, but bring with you some evidence of your current address and ID. Once you are a member, you also may access some resources online remotely. See the website for more on the requirements and how to work with its collections:

[https://www.nls.uk/join/](https://www.nls.uk/join/)

The key to using any of the above resources is acting early in the semester.

#### Essay Outline {#outline} 

Anytime between Week 8-11 you should submit an outline of your essay which includes an overview of how you are thinking of structuring your essay. This should also include a tentative essay title, the argument (updated from your prospectus), and hierarchical bullet points that follow the structure of your essay. You can do this down to the level of paragraphs, but don't include whole paragraphs of text in the outline, just generalized overviews. At the bottom you may include a list of 2-3 questions that you are concerned about or problems you would like advice on. Then book an office hour and come and discuss your outline with me. Make sure you have emailed a copy of your outline to Konrad at least a full 24 hours or more before you meet Konrad in office hours.

### How your Long Essay is Evaluated

The points that follow should be fairly clear from the questions posed above but are restated from the perspective of the marker of a very strong long essay:

- **Important:** The essay gives a clear presentation of its argument in the introduction of the essay
- The argument of the essay is not trivial, overly general, or merely represent a summary of the widely recognized academic consensus on a given topic
- The argument is well signposted, with different sub-arguments of the essay clearly introduced with clear topical sentences.
- The essay shows that extensive reading and research was done in order to write this essay and the evidence is used effectively in support of the argument
- The essay consistently cites its sources with footnotes and these footnotes are generally formatted well.
- The essay engages with the relevant historiography on this topic directly and effectively
- The essay has a good balance between empirical examples and presenting evidence on the one hand, and strong analysis contributing to the argument on the other
- Unless it is a historiographical essay, the essay works with primary sources which make a substantive contribution to its main argument.
- The essay is written well and has a clear structure.
- The essay is within the word limit and of a sufficient length for its proposed scope.
- The School of History Style Guide was carefully followed.
- A well-formatted bibliography is provided showing that research was carried out using sources of an appropriate quality and number.

### Feedback

Feedback is generally provided directly on the mark sheet, which will be posted to the MMS within two weeks. Presentation feedback is provided at two points in the semester so they may be marked in groups. Some formative feedback on Moodle posts (before they are submitted to MMS) will be made sporadically throughout the semester, especially on the first or second post made by a student.
