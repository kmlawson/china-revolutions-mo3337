### Description	

This module traces the modern history of China through the lens of its most transformative political and social changes. It begins with the momentous and transformative rebellions that shook the Qing dynasty to its roots and concludes with the 1989 democracy movement that centered on Tian’anmen square in Beijing. We will examine the ways in which China’s revolutions connected themselves with the past in a process that generated a long and rich revolutionary tradition. We will address the issue of identifying revolutionary agency and the social and economic forces that help drive the most violent transformations of China’s past two centuries.
