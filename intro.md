### Description	

This module traces the history and contradictions of Japan's empire from the first debate over how to “punish” Korea in 1873 and through to consider the early postwar aftermath of Japanese defeat in 1945. We will compare Japanese colonialism in Taiwan, Korea and Okinawa to that of Western empires, the important role of the Sino-Japanese war, and the development of nationalist and pan-Asian ideals.
