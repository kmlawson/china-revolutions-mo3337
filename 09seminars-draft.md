# Seminars

## Week 0 - Orientation

This meeting was held online and a recording of it can be found on our Module Team, as well as a copy of the slides. It went over the structure for the module and the assessments.

## Week 1 - Introduction: Rebellion and Revolution {#reb}

#### Required Reading

Spence, Jonathan D. *The Search for Modern China* Ch 8-11 pp164-254 (in 3rd ed.)

Over the summer, I advised students to read Ch 8-26 of any edition of *The Search for Modern China*. If you didn't find time for this over the summer, I would recommend you do continue to work through the text for that chapter range. The relevant chapters for the week will be listed normally as "background reading" but only this week will they be listed as the required reading.

#### Elective Reading
 
Read either category A or category B readings:
 
(A) Taiping Rebellion
 
- *Cambridge History of China* Vol. 11 ([Ebook](https://library.st-andrews.ac.uk/record=b2401941~S5)) 
    - Ch 6 – The Taiping Rebellion (but can focus on pp274-281, pp291-297, pp316-317)
    - This will provide you with a more detailed overview of the rebellion than Spence provides
- *The Taiping Revolution* (1976) [Archive.org](https://archive.org/details/the-taiping-revolution/mode/1up)  
    - Skim through this book, but especially read pp38-41, 152-159, 168-178
    - This Foreign Languages Press book gives you a Communist approved version of the history of the rebellion. What aspects of the rebellion are emphasised and which aspects underplayed? What aspects of the history are indicative of its Marxist approach? How and when does Mao come into it?
 
(B) Boxer Rebellion
 
- Cohen, Paul A. *History in Three Keys: The Boxers as Event, Experience, and Myth*. Columbia University Press, 1998. Ch 1, 9
- *The Yi Ho Tuan Movement of 1900* (1976) [Archive.org](https://archive.org/details/the-yi-ho-tuan-movement-of-1900). 
    - Skim through this book, but especially read pp12-13, 17-19, 23-24, 95-97, 119-128
    - This Foreign Languages Press book gives you a Communist approved version of the history of the rebellion. What aspects of the rebellion are emphasised and which aspects underplayed? What aspects of the history are indicative of its Marxist approach? How and when does Mao come into it?

#### Mao Reading
 
Please start your daily Mao reading, which you should continue throughout the semester.

* Moodle: Using the module Moodle "Presentation Signup" wiki, sign up for a week to do a presentation on one of the 10 weeks from 2-11. Choose a week with a theme you are interested in but have a backup in case you don't get your first choice. We will revisit this in class if you have any problems.
* Our module is not a general survey of Chinese history but will focus in on the history of its revolutions. While you will get some general background video clips on Chinese history (see below) from week to week, I suggest you purchase an introductory survey text on modern Chinese history to read as the module goes along. A few of the most popular survey texts include:
    * Jonathan Spence, *The Search for Modern China* (old, longer work, but still used as textbook in most courses on modern China) - [library ebook](http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/CBO9781139167253)
	* Diana Lary *China’s Republic* (short, interesting mix of materials)
	* Patricia Ebrey, *Cambridge Illustrated History of China* (if you want something that covers pre-modern period as well)
	* Rana Mitter, *A Bitter Revolution* (we’ll read parts of this, more episodic and character based with a narrower argumentative narrative) - [library ebook](http://www.myilibrary.com/?id=75235)
	* Karl, Rebecca E. *Mao Zedong and China in the Twentieth-Century World: A Concise History* (this has less on the pre-1949 period)
* Memorise the basic chronology in the student handbook up to 1927. Look up 2 of these events online and read a bit about them. Be prepared to say something you find interesting or curious about them.
* Write down 2-3 things about revolution that you know, or alternatively, things that you are hoping to learn about
* Most weeks you will be asked to watch a few clips from the Harvard China X online history course that, while often available from general textbooks, can be a fun visual way to get background information on the week’s topics. This first week, please watch the following clips:
    * Look up William C. Kirby, Peter K. Bol and Mark C. Elliot. What kinds of history do each of these scholars do? They will be in a number of video clips from China X that we will use as a basic introduction to some background in the course.
* ChinaX WorldMap: Visit and browse the spatial data layers for Qing, Republic, and People's Republic on the [China X WorldMap](http://worldmap.harvard.edu/maps/chinaX) (Turn off the pre-Qing layers for a clearer look). Use this map throughout the semester to help orient you in your reading.
* Be ready to sing the dynasty song from the link above!

#### Overview

- Discuss: What things do you already know about the Chinese revolution, what do you want to know about?
- Short Background Mini-lecture
    - Why revolutions in plural, 1911 and 1949, and the long/plural Communist revolutions in China?
    - The proposed logic for the structure of the module
- Task: Form our two "small groups" (小组): "Red Heart" (红心) and "For the People" (为民)
    - in each group, one volunteer will play the informal role of a "backbone element" (骨干分子) who can be relied upon to consistently and enthusiastically support the assigned tasks for group work, and serve as a model for discipline - never straying from their focus or getting distracted. We can swap this role later in the semester if anyone gets tired of being a backbone. 
    - in each of the small groups, one or more students may be individually contacted during the semester to carry out special tasks as "activists" (积极分子)
- Task: Form our "mutual aid groups" (互助小组) of with mostly three students.
- Task: Assemble little red books
- Task: We will have our presentation week sign-ups (in person or recorded)
- Task: Elective readings for next few weeks
- Activity: First mutual aid group meeting to discuss essay topic ideas
- Activity: We will sing the dynasty song together
- Activity: Student presentation(s)
- Activity: Discussion on depictions of these rebellions and their motivations

#### Long Essay Ideas

* The late Qing dynasty was a period of great tumult. There were a large number of western missionaries and merchants in China during this time, however, who have left behind their papers, memoirs, and other records. This includes many from Scotland. As these primary sources are in English and other European languages, those without the ability to read East Asian languages can make use of these rich sources to explore this period.
* The White Lotus rebellion, Taiping Rebellion, Nian rebellion, Boxer Rebellion, Muslim rebellions, "Miao" uprising in Guizhou, the Eight Trigrams Uprising, and others are all rich areas to explore conflict and rebellion in the late Qing dynasty.
* Some of the great rebellions also provide rich terrain for comparative study, or transnational study. Westerners took part in the Taiping Rebellion or witnessed it at close hand. For example, some of the American soldiers sent to join the repression of the Boxer movement were fresh from crushing revolution in the Philippines and Haiti. You may look for some of the many interesting international connections to explore
* Works published before 1923 can be found in great quantities on Archive.org, making this a great place to explore publications about China that can serve as primary sources if published near the time.

#### To Review

- please review for this week's map quiz using the [online map](https://muninn.net/modules/mo3337/map/)
- please keep reviewing your event flashcards.
- choose your era for the semester: Late Qing / Republic / Sino-Japanese Conflict / Rise of the CCP and Civil War / Maoist China
- start your essay research

#### Overview

- Activity: Map Quiz
- Activity: Chinese pronunciations
- Activity: Presentation
- Activity: Example essay titles discussion
- Our seminar discussion will focus quite a bit on the primary sources from the New Culture Movement 
- We will ask students to introduce their elective readings in groups and then to the whole class

#### Questions

1. In what sense was 1911 a revolution? 
2. What kind of legacies did the revolution have and what lost opportunities were there?
3. What are the longer term legacies of the May fourth movement?
4. What are the ways that culture and politics are intertwined in this period?

#### Long Essay Ideas

* 1911 gave rise to a deeply chaotic period during which it is even harder than usual to generalise about changes across China. Consider exploring this early post-1911 period or the "warlord period" more broadly at the regional level.
* Japan, individual Japanese figures, and Chinese in Japan played an important role in the late Qing period, during the 1911 revolution and in the aftermath. There are many aspects of this relationship which are worth examining more closely.
* The new culture movement is an exciting transformative period. In addition to the many new debates being carried out among youth and students within Japan there are many Chinese increasingly active abroad. Focusing in on some aspect of the internationally based Chinese can be an interesting focus for an essay.
* There is a huge amount of English material around this period, especially from the international settlement in Shanghai but also Newspapers and missionary materials, as well as travel accounts. 
* This period overlaps with intense competition among various Western powers and Japan for control in China which will intensify anti-imperialism around China
* There are lots of interesting comparisons to be made between the May 4th Movement and movements elsewhere. The work of Erez Manela on the "Wilsonian Moment" can give you some ideas both for this week, and broader ideas for transnational long essays throughout the essay.

#### Elective Reading

This week we will collectively build up class knowledge about a range of historiographical interventions on the CCPs wartime bases over the past few decades. I would like to ask that all students consider doing one of their three handouts this week on one of the following so that we have at least one (but ideally more) handout for each of the following. As you take notes on the reading, pay especially close attention to how these authors refer to eachother: especially in the case of the texts published in later years who refer back to Johnson, Selden, Kataoka, Chen, etc. What are the stakes in these debates? Consider reading a book review or two of the book you choose.

Background reading: 

*The Search for Modern China* Ch 16-17 but better for our purposes is probabely: Van Slyke, Lyman. ‘The Chinese Communist Movement during the Sino-Japanese War 1937–1945’. In *The Cambridge History of China: Volume 13: Republican China 1912–1949*, edited by Albert Feuerwerker and John K. Fairbank, 13:609–722. The Cambridge History of China. 1986. [DOI](https://doi.org/10.1017/CHOL9780521243384.013).

#### Preparation

- Continue your essay research and bring 1-3 ideas for an essay topic that you have been looking into
- Take a look at some of the essays from previous years that I have shared
- Prepare for this week's event quiz by studying the "China Timeline 1830s-1989" [flashcard set](https://muninn.net/modules/mo3337/flash/) online.
- For the reading today and generally, try not to get bogged down in the details of local case studies - you can skim over those details. Instead keep your eye open for how these authors contest eachothers' general arguments about the role of the wartime period on the rise of the Communist party and its later success in taking power. Make yourself good notes comparing what are sometimes subtle, sometimes very blunt differences in emphasis, agency, use of sources, and forms of evidence.

#### Overview

- Activity: We will have our first events quiz today
- Activity: We will meet with our mutual-aid groups to discuss progress on essay, sharing ideas. 
- We will try to divide our reading discussion into three: primary sources, rectification, but a good chunk of time will be spent on the different approaches to the wartime base areas in the elective readings so please come prepared to introduce your elective reading to others in groups and in the class as a whole.

#### Questions

1. In the debates over the relevance of the second Sino-Japanese war on the rise of the Communist party, evaluate the claims of two historians whose arguments can be said to significantly contradict one another.
2. What is one way that regional differences matter in discussing the impact of the second Sino-Japanese war on the rise of the Communist party during this period?
3. What patterns do you see in the language and style of Mao and Liu's writing?
4. What does "democracy" mean for the Communist Party?
5. What is the party's approach to the public exchange of ideas, art, and literature? How is the view justified?

#### Long Essay Ideas

* This is one of the most active areas of research on modern Chinese history. You might consider wading into this debate in some modest way, perhaps with a focus on a particular case, place, or specific aspect of the argument.
- Our reading has been limited to a focus on the CCP and its base areas but the further reading gives you a taste of the broader context. I would prefer for essays on this period connect at least in some way with the revolution, but this can also be an exploration of Nationalist party revolutionary policies and campaigns such as its New Life movement, or wartime Wuhan and Chongqing. 
* Many international visitors came to China or went from China to other parts of the world and commented on the conflict. Primary sources related to this are more accessible to students don't read Chinese and can offer some interesting perspectives.
* Again here there are rich opportunities for comparative studies or looking at influences and interactions across borders.

## Week 4 - Great Leaps Forward: Violence and Reform 1945-1961 {#gl}

**Preparation:**

* This week brings us from the campaigns around the time of liberation to the end of the Great Leap Forward. My own previous research has included a focus on "anti-treason" campaigns of the mid-1940s against accused collaborators (among others) which overlap somewhat with a wartime "rent and interest reduction campaign" and preparations for the massive and important land reform campaign after Japanese defeat. The land reform campaigns, much of it carried under civil war conditions, was a hugely important and in many places extremely popular campaign that was often looked back upon as the greatest achievement of the Chinese communist party, despite the murder of over a million people in its implementation. The "Great Terror" (Campaign to Suppress Counterrevolutionaries) beginning 1950 may have resulted in the murder of around two million people and was the most concentrated period of political killings in the history of the CCP (The Cultural Revolution impacted a much larger number of people over a longer period of time but is a far more complex event and most likely a smaller aggregate number of victims).
* The "Hundred Flowers" campaign and the repression that followed in its wake is one of the more debated and unusual moments in CCP history but while we have read a bit on this for today, it will not occupy much of our class discussion.

**Overview:**

* We will devote most of our class time to discussing our readings on the Great Leap Forward and its associated famine, which had a devastating impact on China, leading to tens of millions of victims, mostly from starvation.

**Long Essay Ideas:**

* This is also a very dark period in Chinese history and more difficult to explore without the ability to read Chinese primary sources. However, those of you interested in economic history have a lot of possibilities to explore the economic aspects of the great famine (including the role of Chinese exports in this period) and the commune system, and there are also possibilities to explore this period from a comparative perspective.
* There are a range of personal memoirs and accounts that include this period that can form the basis of a student essay.
* From an international perspective it might be interesting to explore how this period was depicted abroad at the time with a close case study.

**Questions:**

1. Do what degree do the severity of the various political campaigns have to do with individual action versus structural factors?
2. Why was the Great Leap famine unusually devastating?

## Week 5 - The Cultural Revolution {#cr}

**Preparation:**

* Moodle: Post a Research Diary entry on the Moodle Forum. See the Moodle for the format of this diary entry. Then post a constructive comment on at least one other student's post. (Entry by Tuesday Morning, Comment by Thursday)
* Watch *Morning Sun* (2003) - 2 Hour Documentary by Carma Hinton. It is available in the library reference area. Consider scheduling a time to watch it together with 2-3 classmates. The fact the DVD was in use the day before class is not an appropriate excuse for not having watched the documentary. Plan ahead. Take notes and be ready to discuss the documentary. This film is considered fair game for the final exam.
* Look through these posters related to the Cultural Revolution by browsing the following page, and then the various pages for individual campaigns 1966-1976:
    * Chineseposters.net: [https://chineseposters.net/themes/cultural-revolution-campaigns.php](https://chineseposters.net/themes/cultural-revolution-campaigns.php)

**Overview:**

* We'll learn a few Chinese phrases popular among young revolutionaries
* We will discuss how one might talk about several cultural revolutions that call for entirely different historical approaches: the focus on a political campaign carried out by Mao that MacFarquhar emphasises; the experience of its violence by its victims; the campaign to send youth to the villages; a localised political transformation; an emancipatory breathe of fresh air for those who participated actively; a period of cultural devastation for China; the way that all of these have come to be remembered.

**Questions:**

1. How does the Cultural Revolution differ from the many political campaigns that preceded it?
2. What are the longer term legacies of the Cultural Revolution?

**Overview:**

* Today we conclude the chronological half of the course with a consideration of a critical turning point in Chinese history, a moment when China shifted from a period of general opening and reform, to one which sacrificed any serious political reform in exchange for stability and economic development.
* We will divide the discussion into two parts: First trying to understand the protests themselves, and then considering them in the much longer history of youth, politics, and mass movements in the history of Chinese revolutions. Then we will shift to thinking about the legacies of the massacre, and how it plays a crucial role in engagement with China today.

**Questions:**

1. How does *The Gate of Heavenly Peace* help transform the way we think about the Tiananmen protests? About mass protest movements in general?
2. The Chinese government, and many Chinese will claim that the blood of Tiananmen was a price to pay in order to avert political chaos that would have resulted in far more violence. What logic and assumptions are at work here? What happens when we generalise these claims to other places and times?

**Overview:**

* In this class we will attempt to understand the impact of the Chinese revolution on other movements around the world, both in the developed world, and in countries as distant as Nepal and Peru. We will consider how aspects of the cultural revolution in particular were attractive, but also how the broader approach of the Chinese revolution offered an alternative radical path for revolutionaries. We will attempt to identify certain patterns in various places but also appreciate local translations of Maoist ideas.

**Questions:**

1. What does it mean to call a movement "Maoist"?
2. What accounts for the sheer variety of Maoist or Maoist inspired movements in the world? How did they differ?

* Gymnaslærer Pedersen (2005) - Comedy about a Norwegian maoist high school teacher
* See You at Mao (1970)

**Overview:**

* We'll split our time between Cohen, moving back to the Boxer Rebellion and how it was deployed in later times, Mittler, which attempts to think more explicitly about the role of culture in Mao's revolution, and Lim, which is more on forgetting than on remembering.
* Task: We will also discuss the three character classic and do an exercise with this in class.
