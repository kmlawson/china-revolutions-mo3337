# Todo

* finish assignments

* redo the 12.11 lecture to be broader, few comprehensive texts on SE experience, better for lecture centric course
* in future iteration merge russo-japanese war and student of imperialism lectures to make more space for a Manchukuo lecture
* ditch the cosmopolitan lecture - better for lecture course until there are better coherent texts?
* need good okinawa overview
* refine pages
* add more primary sources throughout
