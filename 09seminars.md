# Seminars

## Week 0 - Orientation

Optional orientation meeting my office. See email from me for the details.

## Week 1 - Introduction: Rebellion and Revolution {#reb}

### Required Reading

Spence, Jonathan D. *The Search for Modern China* Ch 8-11 pp164-254 (in 3rd ed.)

Over the summer, I advised students to read Ch 8-26 of any edition of *The Search for Modern China*. If you didn't find time for this over the summer, I would recommend you do continue to work through the text for that chapter range. The relevant chapters for the week will be listed normally as "background reading" but only this week will they be listed as the required reading. No ebook, so consider getting your own copy.

### Elective Reading
 
Read either category A or category B readings:
 
(A) Taiping Rebellion
 
- *Cambridge History of China* Vol. 11 ([Ebook](https://librarysearch.st-andrews.ac.uk/permalink/44USTA_INST/6vqs55/alma991017078472308966)) 
    - Ch 6 – The Taiping Rebellion (but can focus on pp274-281, pp291-297, pp316-317)
    - This will provide you with a more detailed overview of the rebellion than Spence provides
- *The Taiping Revolution* (1976) [Archive.org](https://archive.org/details/the-taiping-revolution/mode/1up)  
    - Skim through this book, but especially read pp38-41, 152-159, 168-178
    - This Foreign Languages Press book gives you a Communist approved version of the history of the rebellion. What aspects of the rebellion are emphasised and which aspects underplayed? What aspects of the history are indicative of its Marxist approach? How and when does Mao come into it?
 
(B) Boxer Uprising (Yihequan Movement)
 
- Cohen, Paul A. *History in Three Keys: The Boxers as Event, Experience, and Myth*. Columbia University Press, 1998. Ch 1, 9 [Link](https://librarysearch.st-andrews.ac.uk/permalink/44USTA_INST/6vqs55/alma991009317629708966)

### Mao Reading
 
Please start your daily Mao reading, which you should continue throughout the semester.

### Overview

- Discuss: What things do you already know about the Chinese revolution, what do you want to know about?
- Short Background Mini-lecture
    - Why revolutions in plural, 1911 and 1949, and the long/plural Communist revolutions in China?
    - The proposed logic for the structure of the module
- Task: Form our two "small groups" (小组): "Red Heart" (红心) and "For the People" (为民)
    - in each group, one volunteer will play the informal role of a "backbone element" (骨干分子) who can be relied upon to consistently and enthusiastically support the assigned tasks for group work, and serve as a model for (not a keeper of!) discipline - never straying from their focus or getting distracted. We can swap this role later in the semester if anyone gets tired of being a backbone. 
    - in each of the small groups, one or more students may be individually contacted during the semester to carry out special tasks as "activists" (积极分子)
    - There will be no struggle sessions, self-criticism, or speaking bitterness!
- Task: Form our "mutual aid groups" (互助小组) of with mostly three students.
- Task: Assemble little red books
- Task: We will have our presentation week sign-ups (in person or recorded)
- Task: Elective readings for next two weeks
- Activity: First mutual aid group meeting to discuss essay topic ideas
- Activity: We will sing the dynasty song together
- Activity: Student presentation(s)
- Activity: Discussion on depictions of these rebellions and their motivations

### Long Essay Ideas

* The late Qing dynasty was a period of great tumult. There were a large number of western missionaries and merchants in China during this time, however, who have left behind their papers, memoirs, and other records. This includes many from Scotland. As these primary sources are in English and other European languages, those without the ability to read East Asian languages can make use of these rich sources to explore this period.
* The White Lotus rebellion, Taiping Rebellion, Nian rebellion, Boxer Rebellion, Muslim rebellions, "Miao" uprising in Guizhou, the Eight Trigrams Uprising, and others are all rich areas to explore conflict and rebellion in the late Qing dynasty.
* Some of the great rebellions also provide rich terrain for comparative study, or transnational study. Westerners took part in the Taiping Rebellion or witnessed it at close hand. For example, some of the American soldiers sent to join the repression of the Boxer movement were fresh from crushing revolution in the Philippines and Haiti. You may look for some of the many interesting international connections to explore
* Works published before 1923 can be found in great quantities on Archive.org, making this a great place to explore publications about China that can serve as primary sources if published near the time.

### Preparation

* The reading is relatively heavy this week, please give the primary sources a close look over and don't forget to bring them to class - I would recommend printing them out as otherwise you may get frustrated jumping around in the online interface.

- please review for this week's [map quiz](#maps) using the [online map](https://muninn.net/modules/mo3337/map/)
- please keep reviewing your event flashcards.
- choose your era for the semester: Late Qing / Republic / Sino-Japanese Conflict / Rise of the CCP and Civil War / Maoist China
- start your essay research

### Overview

- Activity: Map Quiz
- Activity: Chinese pronunciations
- Activity: Presentation
- Activity: Example essay titles discussion
- Our seminar discussion will focus quite a bit on the primary sources from the New Culture Movement 
- We will ask students to introduce their elective readings in groups and then to the whole class

### Questions

1. In what sense was 1911 a revolution? 
2. What kind of legacies did the revolution have and what lost opportunities were there?
3. What are the longer term legacies of the May fourth movement?
4. What are the ways that culture and politics are intertwined in this period?

### Long Essay Ideas

* 1911 gave rise to a deeply chaotic period during which it is even harder than usual to generalise about changes across China. Consider exploring this early post-1911 period or the "warlord period" more broadly at the regional level.
* Japan, individual Japanese figures, and Chinese in Japan played an important role in the late Qing period, during the 1911 revolution and in the aftermath. There are many aspects of this relationship which are worth examining more closely.
* The new culture movement is an exciting transformative period. In addition to the many new debates being carried out among youth and students within Japan there are many Chinese increasingly active abroad. Focusing in on some aspect of the internationally based Chinese can be an interesting focus for an essay.
* There is a huge amount of English material around this period, especially from the international settlement in Shanghai but also Newspapers and missionary materials, as well as travel accounts. 
* This period overlaps with intense competition among various Western powers and Japan for control in China which will intensify anti-imperialism around China
* There are lots of interesting comparisons to be made between the May 4th Movement and movements elsewhere. The work of Erez Manela on the "Wilsonian Moment" can give you some ideas both for this week, and broader ideas for transnational long essays throughout the essay.

## Week 3 - Building Revolution and the War with Japan, 1931-1945 {#sj}

Between the May Fourth Movement and the outbreak of full scale war with Japan in 1937 there are several weeks worth of important events. Key among them are the 1927 Northern Expedition under the United Front, the end of the United Front and Chiang Kai-shek's large scale massacres of suspected Communists in Shanghai, the emergence of the first Chinese soviets and failed attempts to take key cities, Chiang Kai-shek's encirclement campaigns and the long march that eventually leads what remains of Communist forces to Shaanxi, and the return of a fragile and United Front after the Xian incident and Japan's full-scale invasion in 1937. In this week, however, we are going to focus on the period from 1937-1945 on Communist controlled base areas.

### Preparation

- Continue your essay research and bring 1-3 ideas for an essay topic that you have been looking into
- Take a look at some of the essays from previous years that I have shared
- Prepare for this week's event quiz by studying the "China Timeline 1830s-1989" [flashcard set](https://muninn.net/modules/mo3337/flash/) online.
- For the reading today and generally, try not to get bogged down in the details of local case studies - you can skim over those details. Instead keep your eye open for how these authors contest eachothers' general arguments about the role of the wartime period on the rise of the Communist party and its later success in taking power. Make yourself good notes comparing what are sometimes subtle, sometimes very blunt differences in emphasis, agency, use of sources, and forms of evidence.

### Overview

- Activity: We will have our first [Events Quiz](#events) today
- Activity: We will meet with our mutual-aid groups to discuss progress on essay, sharing ideas, and reflecting on the model essays that were shared
- Activity: Presentation
- We will try to divide our reading discussion into three: primary sources, rectification, but a good chunk of time will be spent on the different approaches to the wartime base areas in the elective readings so please come prepared to introduce your elective reading to others in groups and in the class as a whole.

### Questions

1. How important was the experience of the Sino-Japanese war to the rise of the Communist Party?
2. What are the key differences in the interpretations among various historians about the key elements of the wartime experience?
3. To what degree does the place (which base area and its context and features), agents (the people and groups focused upon), and the sources available shape the analysis by historians of the wartime experience?
4. In the debates over the relevance of the second Sino-Japanese war on the rise of the Communist party, evaluate the claims of two historians whose arguments can be said to significantly contradict one another.
5. What patterns do you see in the language and style of Mao and Liu's writing among the primary sources? 
6. What does "democracy" mean for the Communist Party?
7. What is the party's approach to the public exchange of ideas, art, and literature? How is the view justified? What longer term consequences do you think this will have for China?

### Long Essay Ideas

- This is one of the most active areas of research on modern Chinese history. You might consider wading into this debate in some modest way, perhaps with a focus on a particular case, place, or specific aspect of the argument.
- Our reading has been limited to a focus on the CCP and its base areas but the further reading gives you a taste of the broader context. I would prefer for essays on this period connect at least in some way with the revolution, but this can also be an exploration of Nationalist party revolutionary policies and campaigns such as its New Life movement, or wartime Wuhan and Chongqing.
- Many international visitors came to China or went from China to other parts of the world and commented on the conflict. Primary sources related to this are more accessible to students don't read Chinese and can offer some interesting perspectives.
- Again here there are rich opportunities for comparative studies or looking at influences and interactions across borders.

## Week 4 - Great Leaps Forward: Violence and Reform 1945-1961 {#gl}

Japanese surrender in 1945 is soon followed by civil war on a huge scale, one which had already been brewing in the renewed conflict between the CCP and the Nationalist government at least since the New Fourth Army incident of 1941 but already in the years up to it. We cannot dedicate much time to the war itself, but the idea that its outcome was somehow predetermined has come under much challenge by historians of the war. If we look more broadly at the political campaigns of the transwar period from the late wartime to 1950, we see a growing confidence in the party's willingness to carry out large scale campaigns that will result in the dismantlement of social and economic elites throughout the countryside, including the rent and interest reduction campaign, the anti-traitor campaign, and the land reform campaigns. It is in the links between these campaigns we can find the emergence of a set of important political technologies that are the successors to earlier versions found in the base areas of the early 1930s or Soviet practices, including the art of the public mass trial and "speaking bitterness." After the formation of the People's Republic in 1949, during the Korean War, the Campaign to Suppress Counterrevolutionaries (Zhenfan 镇反) will revisit the earlier "magnanimous" policy of the wartime towards some associates of the Nationalists or the Japanese, execute hundreds of thousands of suspected "counterrevolutionaries" and will both rival and overlap with the violence of the land reform campaigns. Finally, after a period of recovery, Mao will launch his famous "Hundred Flowers" movement followed quickly by the Anti-Rightist campaign and the launch of the Great Leap Forward in 1958 that will result in the most devastating man-made famine in history.

### Preparation

- If you wish to submit a [Draft Prospectus](#formative), please share this on Teams by the night before class. We will make time for discussion around this in class.
- Please continue your research for your essay
- Don't forget your daily Mao reading, "Study well, to become better every day!" (好好学习天天向上!)
- consider coming to talk to me about your essay ideas in office hours.

### Overview

- Activity: We will break into our mutual aid groups to discuss draft prospectuses. If anyone in your group hasn't submitted one, please: no struggle sessions, but ask them how things are coming along with their research. 
- Activity: Presentation 
- We will have a small group discussion on the land reform questions below.
- We will devote most of our class time to discussing our readings on the Great Leap Forward and especially its associated famine, which had a devastating impact on China

### Questions

1. The land reform campaign is looked back upon as perhaps the crowning achievement of the Communist Party. Why is this the case? What do you think the arguments are in favor or against such an evaluation?
2. "In many places land reform - or at least the class struggle that it implies, was, in large part, already complete before land reform began." Discuss and evaluate this claim.
2. Why was the Great Leap famine unusually devastating? 
3. What are arguments can be made in favor of different explanations for the Great Leap?
4. Answer Jeremy Brown's question for students in elective reading (G), "Imagine that China held an open presidential election after Japan surrendered in August 1945. For whom would you have voted?"

### Long Essay Ideas

- This is also a very dark period in Chinese history and somewhat more difficult to explore without the ability to read Chinese primary sources. However, those of you interested in economic history have a lot of possibilities to explore the economic aspects of the great famine (including the role of Chinese exports in this period) and the commune system, and there are also possibilities to explore this period from a comparative perspective.
- Thinking of things in terms of broad areas, not all of which were included in our seminar discussion: anti-traitor and settling of accounts movements, land reform, civil war period, urban revolutions and student movements, end of Western imperialism in China, China's involvement in Korea, Zhenfan, other campaigns such as the Three-Anti and Five Anti, the Hundred Flowers and the Anti-Rightist campaign, the Great Leap in industry, and the Great Famine in agriculture.
- There are a range of personal memoirs and accounts that include this period that can form the basis of a student essay. A number of these have been translated or were written by non-Chinese visitors.
- From an international perspective it might be interesting to explore how this period was depicted abroad at the time with a close case study.

## Week 5 - The Cultural Revolution {#cr}

Together with the war of resistance against Japan, this is the most iconic and frequently depicted period in modern Chinese history. We will attempt to disentangle the Cultural Revolution (CR) by exploring its different stages, the different scales at which we can analyse it, attempts to understand and explain it, and the experiences of those who lived through it.

### Preparation

- Browse these posters related to the Cultural Revolution by browsing the following page, and then the various pages for individual campaigns 1966-1976:
    - Chineseposters.net: [https://chineseposters.net/themes/cultural-revolution-campaigns.php](https://chineseposters.net/themes/cultural-revolution-campaigns.php)
- Please use this week to make serious progress on your long essay and make a plan and schedule for the use of your independent learning week.
- Take a look at some of the sample essays that are shared in Teams

**Overview:**

- Activity: Event Quiz 2
- Activity: Mutual aid group discussion around essay progress and example essays shared. 
- Activity: Presentation
- We will discuss how one might talk about several cultural revolutions that call for entirely different historical approaches: the focus on a political campaign carried out by Mao that MacFarquhar emphasises; the experience of its violence by its victims; the campaign to send youth to the villages; a localised political transformation; an emancipatory breathe of fresh air for those who participated actively; a period of cultural devastation for China; the way that all of these have come to be remembered.
- Activity: We will have a small group discussion around the broader causes and legacies of the CR. What do you understand these to be from the reading? To what degree do your elective readings allow you to better understand it, and why are some of them less able to answer that question?
- Activity: We will have a small group discussion which focuses on elective readings. Share with your group how your elective reading allows you to better understand an aspect of the experience of the CR in a place, at a time, or from the perspective of particular sets of agents.

**Questions:**

1. How might we best explain what the Cultural Revolution was as a whole? 
2. To what degree is it more useful to see the CR from the perspective of a top down political struggle, or a series of society-wide experiences? How might we balance the two?
2. How does the Cultural Revolution differ from the many political campaigns that preceded it?
3. What are the longer term legacies of the Cultural Revolution?

### Long Essays

The cultural revolution is one of the most fascinating periods of PRC history. There are many published accounts translated from Chinese or written in English, as well as visual sources, documentary collections (The *Not a Dinner Party* collection edited by Schoenhals is one important one) and literary materials that can form the basis of a student essay.

## Independent Learning Week {#ilw}

Make good progress on your essay this week. Your graded prospectus is due Week 7. 

## Week 7 - From Reform to June Fourth: Tiananmen {#tian}

This week will focus primarily on the 1989 Tiananmen protests and massacre which ends a period of combined economic and cultural opening up after the death of Mao Zedong in 1976. 1989 weighs heavily in contemporary Chinese history as a turning point that sets the foundations of political developments in its aftermath.

### Preparation

- Your prospectus is due this week. During the ILW you should have made considerable progress on the research for your essay including: settling on a topic, identifying primary sources and appropriate historiography, and thinking about how to structure the essay.
- From this week onwards it is particularly important to reserve enough of your 15-20 hours per week spent on this module to focus on your essay. If you can read 30 pages per hour, try not to spend more than 8-9 hours on the weekly reading and save the rest of the time on your essay and any remaining posts.

### Overview

1. In mutual aid groups we will share your prospectus. Each person will be given a few minutes and will be asked to elaborate on a) argument b) sources c) "so what?" d) challenges e) next step
2. Reflections on *The Gate of Heavenly Peace* and Jeremy Brown's perspective on it.
3. We will discuss the primary source documents together
4. Presentation
5. June Fourth: context, event, and legacy
6. Drawing on insights from the elective readings

### Questions

1. What are continuities and differences between the students of 1989 and earlier periods?
2. How does space, from the square to the city to the country need to be taken into account in our study of these events?
3. How would you characterise the similarities and differences between Tiananmen and the protests in Hong Kong in recent years?
4. The Chinese government, and many Chinese will claim that the blood of Tiananmen was a price to pay in order to avert political chaos that would have resulted in far more violence. What logic and assumptions are at work here? What happens when we generalise these claims to other places and times?

### Long Essays

The protests and massacre in 1989 has produced a lot of primary source material and some memoirs both in English but especially in Chinese (for the latter see me as I may have access to some of these works). More broadly, however, students are welcome to explore essays that engage with the reform period from the late 1970s and through the 1980s but I would prefer that you not venture too much beyond 1989 in order to retain a tighter chronological focus for the module.

## Week 8 - Reforming Thought {#sixiang}

This week we will explore the phenomenon of thought reform (sixiang gaizao 思想改造) and especially the method of "criticism and self-criticism" (piping yu ziwo piping 批评与自我批评) as central to the Chinese revolutionary project. We will see how it was used in political campaigns but also became a key element of disciplinary, penal, and educational cultures in general. Some of our readings will go broader to reflect on the ways in which language and discourse are used to shape the revolutionary subject.

### Preparation

- Continue to work on your essay. I encourage you to start the writing by this week, even if it is drafting some of the most basic paragraphs providing background or historiographical overview. 
- Bring one (or a short part) of your primary sources (or secondary if you are doing a historiography piece) to class. Be prepared to share with your group what you think you can use your source to argue (as part of a sub-argument or your essay's main argument)

### Overview

- In mutual aid groups we will have an opportunity to share some essay sources with each other and what you may use the source to argue.
- We will ask several volunteers to report on progress on their essay to the group as a whole.
- In small groups we will discuss the institution of criticism and self-criticism, letters or diaries of self-criticism, and their role in political ritual and group interactions. 
- In small groups we will share findings from the elective readings and one presenter from each of the two groups will share these findings to the full class.

### Questions

- To what degree does criticism and self-criticism in revolutionary China represent something which is found widely across cultures, within the Communist world, or represent a distinctive political innovation?
- What arguments can be brought for and against the idea of this institution being a highly effective one? How might the context, or a consideration of the question "effective for what?" change our answer?
- Beyond its use merely in the context of labor and reform camps or specific campaigns, it can be said that thought reform permeates everything the PRC state does. Discuss, delimit, and contest this statement.

### Long Essays

Thought reform is best represented in English language in the memoirs and other accounts of individuals who spent time in re-education through labour and reform through labour camps as well as in rectification campaigns. Essays which develop an argument based on evidence from these sources, when considered carefully, are welcome. Thinking about mass persuasion and social control in general, the institutions of education, broader social propaganda, and cultural institutions are an excellent direction to go.

### Overview

At this point in the semester you should definitely have begun your writing process for the long essay. You should be getting your prospectus feedback and if you are contemplating a pivot in your topic, I suggest that, at this point, try to stick relatively close to your original intended focus. 

During the class we will focus some discussion on the primary sources, and an extended discussion around the impact of questions related to gender and family on the broader narratives of the Communist revolution, especially (see Question 1 below). 

### Questions

1. Do our readings contribute to the "May Fourth story" that Hershatter is referring to below? What kinds of historical texts and sources may contribute or contest that narrative? 

Gail Hershatter: "A course that begins with the late imperial period and moves through the history of revolutions runs the risk of becoming a narrative that reproduces the Communist revolution’s story about itself: that it was a progressive move from darkness into light. It doesn’t matter how much time I spend talking about the accomplishments of educated women in the Qing, or pushing students not just to denounce footbinding, but to consider why women who bound their daughters’ feet regarded themselves as fulfilling a motherly duty, and why daughters understood it as an unquestioned, if painful, part of growing up female. Students head straight for what historian Dorothy Ko has called the “May Fourth story”—a version of the Chinese past developed by radical social critics in the 1910s and 1920s arguing feudal society oppressed, sequestered, and deformed women, and that only modernity (directed by mostly male intellectuals) could free them. The Party-led revolution then becomes the fulfillment of that promise" - in "On Learning to Resist Verdicts and Disappearances: Teaching about Gender in Mao’s China" *PRC Review* Vol. 6, No. 4 (October 2021)

2. What are some of the contradictions that exist in post-1949 PRC policies regarding women? 
3. Thinking more broadly, what can we say about how masculinity and femininity is deployed in modern Chinese political contexts?

### Long Essays

This is a topic which is often represented by its own module. If you are thinking of writing a long essay in this area, consider exploring the further reading for one of the periods: Qing, Republican period, or for a CCP/PRC focus. You can see from the diversity of topics from our required and elective readings that there a range of very distinct directions you can take an essay in this general area.

### Overview

Maoism, and especially China of the cultural revolution had an electrifying impact around the world. Around the world, organised "Maoist", "(Marxist-Leninist)", and "anti-revisionist" parties found in China (and Albania) an inspirational alternative and in many ways more radical alternative to the Soviet Union or the older Trotskyist parties. In most places these parties were very small and of limited or no significant influence on the broader left. In a broader field, however, Chinese revolutionary politics and Mao's ideas found much wider influence on culture, in academic circles, among philosophers of revolutionary praxis, and it also played supporting and inspirational role in inspiring a number of violent groups that sought funding through bank robberies, carried out violent purges within groups, or spectacular acts of terrorism to draw attention to a revolutionary cause. 

This week we will share some readings in common, including some readings around the small group of Scottish marxists, and then ask students to share aspects of their elective reading cases with each other and the class as a whole. 

### Questions

1. What does being a "Maoist" or a "Maoist party" mean in these different cases? 
2. What are some features of these other movements that would Mao like? What might he be less happy about? 
3. If Mao "sinicized" Marxism, what are ways in which these movements adapted Maoism to their own context?

### Long Essays

The advantage of long essays related to this week's topic is that you can work with sources in a very wide range of languages and related to a wide range of countries. See the further reading section for some ideas.

## Week 11 - History and Memory {#history}

### Required Reading

*Primary Sources:* (~25-70)

The following three resolutions are the "historical resolutions" that helped establish the Communist Party's officially recognized narrative of its recent past, and by extension, that of the People's Republic. We wil spend a good amount of time in class analysing these documents. You do not need to read all three documents in full. Instead, choose one of the following three options reading pages from the E=English or C=Chinese version, as you prefer, using the version for all these shared in the Files.

### Overview

This is your last week of the semester so the reading is lighter this week. After checking in with some volunteers on progress with their essay, we will focus our classroom discussion on an analysis of three famous historical resolutions of the CCP from our primary sources. What time we have leftover will be in group work and plenary discussion of the elective readings, which bring in questions of memory and history in a much broader way. 

### Questions

1. How has the CCP's evaluation of its primary successes and failures changed over time? 
2. Beyond the empirical content, what are changes in the style and approach of the historical resolutions across the three?
3. How might these documents serve to constrain what historical scholarship is possible to write? Where is there greater ambiguity and flexibility?

### Long Essays

As we saw from very early in the semester, there are many Chinese historical works, including pamphlets, textbooks, and magazines which engage with China's history. Students might want to explore and analyse the CCP (or pre-CCP) historical writing. Memoirs and other accounts are also something that can be analysed not merely for what they can and cannot tell us about the times they describe but analysed more broadly or in aggregate.
