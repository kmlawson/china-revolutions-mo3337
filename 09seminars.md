# Seminars

## Week 0 - Orientation

This meeting was held online and a recording of it can be found on our Module Team, as well as a copy of the slides. It went over the structure for the module and the assessments.

## Week 1 - Introduction: Rebellion and Revolution {#reb}

### Required Reading

Spence, Jonathan D. *The Search for Modern China* Ch 8-11 pp164-254 (in 3rd ed.)

Over the summer, I advised students to read Ch 8-26 of any edition of *The Search for Modern China*. If you didn't find time for this over the summer, I would recommend you do continue to work through the text for that chapter range. The relevant chapters for the week will be listed normally as "background reading" but only this week will they be listed as the required reading.

### Elective Reading
 
Read either category A or category B readings:
 
(A) Taiping Rebellion
 
- *Cambridge History of China* Vol. 11 ([Ebook](https://library.st-andrews.ac.uk/record=b2401941~S5)) 
    - Ch 6 – The Taiping Rebellion (but can focus on pp274-281, pp291-297, pp316-317)

### Mao Reading
 
Please start your daily Mao reading, which you should continue throughout the semester.

### Overview

- Discuss: What things do you already know about the Chinese revolution, what do you want to know about?
- Short Background Mini-lecture
    - Why revolutions in plural, 1911 and 1949, and the long/plural Communist revolutions in China?
    - The proposed logic for the structure of the module
- Task: Form our two "small groups" (小组): "Red Heart" (红心) and "For the People" (为民)
    - in each group, one volunteer will play the informal role of a "backbone element" (骨干分子) who can be relied upon to consistently and enthusiastically support the assigned tasks for group work, and serve as a model for (not a keeper of!) discipline - never straying from their focus or getting distracted. We can swap this role later in the semester if anyone gets tired of being a backbone. 
    - in each of the small groups, one or more students may be individually contacted during the semester to carry out special tasks as "activists" (积极分子)
    - There will be no struggle sessions, self-criticism, or speaking bitterness!
- Task: Form our "mutual aid groups" (互助小组) of with mostly three students.
- Task: Assemble little red books
- Task: We will have our presentation week sign-ups (in person or recorded)
- Task: Elective readings for next two weeks
- Activity: First mutual aid group meeting to discuss essay topic ideas
- Activity: We will sing the dynasty song together
- Activity: Student presentation(s)
- Activity: Discussion on depictions of these rebellions and their motivations

### Long Essay Ideas

* The late Qing dynasty was a period of great tumult. There were a large number of western missionaries and merchants in China during this time, however, who have left behind their papers, memoirs, and other records. This includes many from Scotland. As these primary sources are in English and other European languages, those without the ability to read East Asian languages can make use of these rich sources to explore this period.
* The White Lotus rebellion, Taiping Rebellion, Nian rebellion, Boxer Rebellion, Muslim rebellions, "Miao" uprising in Guizhou, the Eight Trigrams Uprising, and others are all rich areas to explore conflict and rebellion in the late Qing dynasty.
* Some of the great rebellions also provide rich terrain for comparative study, or transnational study. Westerners took part in the Taiping Rebellion or witnessed it at close hand. For example, some of the American soldiers sent to join the repression of the Boxer movement were fresh from crushing revolution in the Philippines and Haiti. You may look for some of the many interesting international connections to explore
* Works published before 1923 can be found in great quantities on Archive.org, making this a great place to explore publications about China that can serve as primary sources if published near the time.

### To Review

- please review for this week's map quiz using the [online map](https://muninn.net/modules/mo3337/map/)
- please keep reviewing your event flashcards.
- choose your era for the semester: Late Qing / Republic / Sino-Japanese Conflict / Rise of the CCP and Civil War / Maoist China
- start your essay research

### Overview

- Activity: Map Quiz
- Activity: Chinese pronunciations
- Activity: Presentation
- Activity: Example essay titles discussion
- Our seminar discussion will focus quite a bit on the primary sources from the New Culture Movement 
- We will ask students to introduce their elective readings in groups and then to the whole class

### Questions

1. In what sense was 1911 a revolution? 
2. What kind of legacies did the revolution have and what lost opportunities were there?
3. What are the longer term legacies of the May fourth movement?
4. What are the ways that culture and politics are intertwined in this period?

### Long Essay Ideas

* 1911 gave rise to a deeply chaotic period during which it is even harder than usual to generalise about changes across China. Consider exploring this early post-1911 period or the "warlord period" more broadly at the regional level.
* Japan, individual Japanese figures, and Chinese in Japan played an important role in the late Qing period, during the 1911 revolution and in the aftermath. There are many aspects of this relationship which are worth examining more closely.
* The new culture movement is an exciting transformative period. In addition to the many new debates being carried out among youth and students within Japan there are many Chinese increasingly active abroad. Focusing in on some aspect of the internationally based Chinese can be an interesting focus for an essay.
* There is a huge amount of English material around this period, especially from the international settlement in Shanghai but also Newspapers and missionary materials, as well as travel accounts. 
* This period overlaps with intense competition among various Western powers and Japan for control in China which will intensify anti-imperialism around China
* There are lots of interesting comparisons to be made between the May 4th Movement and movements elsewhere. The work of Erez Manela on the "Wilsonian Moment" can give you some ideas both for this week, and broader ideas for transnational long essays throughout the essay.

### Elective Reading

This week we will collectively build up class knowledge about a range of historiographical interventions on the CCPs wartime bases over the past few decades. I would like to ask that all students consider doing one of their three handouts this week on one of the following so that we have at least one (but ideally more) handout for each of the following. As you take notes on the reading, pay especially close attention to how these authors refer to eachother: especially in the case of the texts published in later years who refer back to Johnson, Selden, Kataoka, Chen, etc. What are the stakes in these debates? Consider reading a book review or two of the book you choose.

- For the reading today and generally, try not to get bogged down in the details of local case studies - you can skim over those details. Instead keep your eye open for how these authors contest eachothers' general arguments about the role of the wartime period on the rise of the Communist party and its later success in taking power. Make yourself good notes comparing what are sometimes subtle, sometimes very blunt differences in emphasis, agency, use of sources, and forms of evidence.

### Overview

- Activity: We will have our first events quiz today
- Activity: We will meet with our mutual-aid groups to discuss progress on essay, sharing ideas, and reflecting on the model essays
- We will try to divide our reading discussion into three: primary sources, rectification, but a good chunk of time will be spent on the different approaches to the wartime base areas in the elective readings so please come prepared to introduce your elective reading to others in groups and in the class as a whole.

### Questions

1. In the debates over the relevance of the second Sino-Japanese war on the rise of the Communist party, evaluate the claims of two historians whose arguments can be said to significantly contradict one another.
2. What is one way that regional differences matter in discussing the impact of the second Sino-Japanese war on the rise of the Communist party during this period?
3. What patterns do you see in the language and style of Mao and Liu's writing?
4. What does "democracy" mean for the Communist Party?
5. What is the party's approach to the public exchange of ideas, art, and literature? How is the view justified?

### Long Essay Ideas

* This is one of the most active areas of research on modern Chinese history. You might consider wading into this debate in some modest way, perhaps with a focus on a particular case, place, or specific aspect of the argument.
- Our reading has been limited to a focus on the CCP and its base areas but the further reading gives you a taste of the broader context. I would prefer for essays on this period connect at least in some way with the revolution, but this can also be an exploration of Nationalist party revolutionary policies and campaigns such as its New Life movement, or wartime Wuhan and Chongqing. 
* Many international visitors came to China or went from China to other parts of the world and commented on the conflict. Primary sources related to this are more accessible to students don't read Chinese and can offer some interesting perspectives.
* Again here there are rich opportunities for comparative studies or looking at influences and interactions across borders.
