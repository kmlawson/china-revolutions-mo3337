## Assignments

The assessed portion of the coursework for this module consists of one essay, a group presentation, and three short essays responding to weekly discussion questions. In addition, students are required to to come prepared each week having completed the assigned reading and prepared to discuss them.

### Long Essay

The essay for the course is worth 30% of the total grade and should be between 4,000-4,500 words. Footnotes and bibliography are not included in this count. The process of composing an essay of this length is made far easier if make steady progress throughout the semester rather than face potential panic and disappointment nearer the deadline. Narrow down an area of interest, read within this area of interest, isolate a few questions of interest, carry out further reading and analysis, and then proceed to write an essay which makes a convincing historical argument. 

Some class time on week three will be dedicated to discussing the essay. At that time, please send me two or three general potential topics of interest that are related to the course theme, the name of one or two secondary or primary historical works related to each, and a brief note as to why you chose that work. I will give feedback on the ideas, and throughout the semester encourage students to visit me in office hours to help discuss the move from general topics of interest to specific historical questions. I am also willing to look at an outline of your essay, your final list of sources (at least six, and at least one primary source unless you are writing a historiographical piece), and a draft of the essay.

The essay should follow the school of history style sheet and observe the rules for conduct. See the relevant sections below.

Some questions to ask yourself as you write the long essay:

* Does the essay have a clear introduction which articulates the argument I wish to make in the essay?
* Can the argument of the essay be meaningfully contradicted and have I argued why my argument is better than alternative explanations?
* Do I mention inconvenient facts that may force me to qualify my argument, and address them appropriately?
* Does the essay have a clear conclusion which restates the main points?
* Does the essay situate the argument being made in the context of the sources used, and its relevance to the study of the course theme (the "so what" question)? 
* Does the essay show a good understanding of the sources used, and use them effectively in supporting my argument?
* Does the essay avoid long quotations from secondary works whenever possible?
* Have I used a variety of appropriate sources?
* Did I make connections between my essay and the readings and discussions througout the semester in the module?
* Does the essay retain a strong focus on the main argument, and avoid passages which stray significantly from the main points?
* Does the essay avoid being a summary or introduction to a particular topic, event, or person in order to make a clear argument that is falsifiable?
* Does the essay consider alternative explanations, acknowledge inconvenient facts, and point out sources or historians who may have differing approaches?

**Note:** In many introductory courses it is common to set a very straightforward and general question for an essay with a clear yes or no answer which is then provided in the form of an argument. This is no longer that common in published work on history and, in the interests of learning to write essays that are closer to the form of academic published articles, it is not suggested that this approach is taken.

### Group Presentation

On the first week you will be divided into groups of three or two students. This will be your group presentation group. As you consult the seminar reading list below you will see "group presentation opportunities" listed in most weeks. These are topics related to the week's discussion that are not covered in detail by the assigned reading. By the second week choose one of these group presentation opportunities to present on. Your group will be given 30 minutes (roughly 10 minutes per student) for groups of three and 20 minutes for groups of two to present on the topic. The presentation can be historiographical and serve as a summary and presentation of the arguments and material found in a selection of readings on the topic. Unlike the essays, there does not need to be a consistent overarching argument.

The presentation should include a handout distributed to all students the day of the presentation and emailed to the lecturer by the day of the presentation. The handout should include: key dates, names, and places referred to, and a brief outline of points covered and arguments made. You may use a powerpoint or other slide presentation but it is not required, nor will it necessarily get a better mark than a well organized and delivered presentation without any visual aids. If you use a slide presentation it should avoid a bullet-pointed text-heavy approach and focus on introducing key images, major themes, or a few select quotations. 

Questions to consider as you prepare:

* Did the distributed handout accurately summarize the general points to be made in the presentation
* If appropriate, did the handout include any important dates, sources, or a map for the discussion?
* Was the 20 (for two presenters) or 30 minute limit (for three presenters) strictly observed in the presentation as divided between presenters?
* Was the presentation well structured, organized, and focus on a few key points?
* Was there a good balance of presented arguments from the material on the topic chosen and a few examples to support them?
* Did the material presented by each member of the group fit coherently together as a unit?

### Short Essays

There will be two discussion questions circulated for every week except the first. These questions will help you think about the assigned readings for the following week's session. The short essay is a short 300-400 word essay which should argue as clearly as possible an answer to one of the discussion questions from the weeks preceding the due date (see below). It should begin with a clear statement of the answer and be followed with support from the assigned readings. A truly outstanding essay should show very solid selection of supportive evidence and go beyond the question to draw comparisons with other weeks or beyond the course. Footnotes are not required, but a recognizable reference to the source author and page number should be included when referring to something in our reading.

**Short Essay 1:** On a question from week 2 or week 3  
**Short Essay 2:** On a question from week 4 or week 5  
**Short Essay 3:** On a question from week 6-9  

Questions to consider as you write the short essay:

* Did my short essay clearly state a summary of my answer somewhere near the opening of the short essay?
* Did my short essay consider, acknowledge, and address alternative interpretations or counter arguments to the argument?
* Did my short essay use only short quotations if any?
* Did my short essay use strong examples from the assigned reading to make my argument?
* Was my short essay written in a coherent and highly focused manner, and avoid distraction or unnecessary information?
