## Week 0 - Orientation

Optional orientation meeting my office. See email from me for the details.

## Week 1 - Introduction: Rebellion and Revolution {#reb}

### Required Reading

Spence, Jonathan D. *The Search for Modern China* Ch 8-11 pp164-254 (in 3rd ed.)

Over the summer, I advised students to read Ch 8-26 of any edition of *The Search for Modern China*. If you didn't find time for this over the summer, I would recommend you do continue to work through the text for that chapter range. The relevant chapters for the week will be listed normally as "background reading" but only this week will they be listed as the required reading. No ebook, so consider getting your own copy.

### Elective Reading
 
Read either category A or category B readings:
 
(A) Taiping Rebellion
 
- *Cambridge History of China* Vol. 11 ([Ebook](https://librarysearch.st-andrews.ac.uk/permalink/44USTA_INST/6vqs55/alma991017078472308966)) 
    - Ch 6 – The Taiping Rebellion (but can focus on pp274-281, pp291-297, pp316-317)

### Mao Reading
 
Please start your daily Mao reading, which you should continue throughout the semester.

### Overview

- Discuss: What things do you already know about the Chinese revolution, what do you want to know about?
- Short Background Mini-lecture
    - Why revolutions in plural, 1911 and 1949, and the long/plural Communist revolutions in China?
    - The proposed logic for the structure of the module
- Task: Form our two "small groups" (小组): "Red Heart" (红心) and "For the People" (为民)
    - in each group, one volunteer will play the informal role of a "backbone element" (骨干分子) who can be relied upon to consistently and enthusiastically support the assigned tasks for group work, and serve as a model for (not a keeper of!) discipline - never straying from their focus or getting distracted. We can swap this role later in the semester if anyone gets tired of being a backbone. 
    - in each of the small groups, one or more students may be individually contacted during the semester to carry out special tasks as "activists" (积极分子)
    - There will be no struggle sessions, self-criticism, or speaking bitterness!
- Task: Form our "mutual aid groups" (互助小组) of with mostly three students.
- Task: Assemble little red books
- Task: We will have our presentation week sign-ups (in person or recorded)
- Task: Elective readings for next two weeks
- Activity: First mutual aid group meeting to discuss essay topic ideas
- Activity: We will sing the dynasty song together
- Activity: Student presentation(s)
- Activity: Discussion on depictions of these rebellions and their motivations

### Long Essay Ideas

* The late Qing dynasty was a period of great tumult. There were a large number of western missionaries and merchants in China during this time, however, who have left behind their papers, memoirs, and other records. This includes many from Scotland. As these primary sources are in English and other European languages, those without the ability to read East Asian languages can make use of these rich sources to explore this period.
* The White Lotus rebellion, Taiping Rebellion, Nian rebellion, Boxer Rebellion, Muslim rebellions, "Miao" uprising in Guizhou, the Eight Trigrams Uprising, and others are all rich areas to explore conflict and rebellion in the late Qing dynasty.
* Some of the great rebellions also provide rich terrain for comparative study, or transnational study. Westerners took part in the Taiping Rebellion or witnessed it at close hand. For example, some of the American soldiers sent to join the repression of the Boxer movement were fresh from crushing revolution in the Philippines and Haiti. You may look for some of the many interesting international connections to explore
* Works published before 1923 can be found in great quantities on Archive.org, making this a great place to explore publications about China that can serve as primary sources if published near the time.
