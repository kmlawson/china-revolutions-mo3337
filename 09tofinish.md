As with Morning Sun, this documentary is available in the library in the reference area and again consider watching it in groups. This film is considered fair game for the final exam.

**Overview:**

* Today we conclude the chronological half of the course with a consideration of a critical turning point in Chinese history, a moment when China shifted from a period of general opening and reform, to one which sacrificed any serious political reform in exchange for stability and economic development.
* We will divide the discussion into two parts: First trying to understand the protests themselves, and then considering them in the much longer history of youth, politics, and mass movements in the history of Chinese revolutions. Then we will shift to thinking about the legacies of the massacre, and how it plays a crucial role in engagement with China today.

**Questions:**

1. How does *The Gate of Heavenly Peace* help transform the way we think about the Tiananmen protests? About mass protest movements in general?
2. The Chinese government, and many Chinese will claim that the blood of Tiananmen was a price to pay in order to avert political chaos that would have resulted in far more violence. What logic and assumptions are at work here? What happens when we generalise these claims to other places and times?

**Overview:**

* We'll split our time between Cohen, moving back to the Boxer Rebellion and how it was deployed in later times, Mittler, which attempts to think more explicitly about the role of culture in Mao's revolution, and Lim, which is more on forgetting than on remembering.
* Task: We will also discuss the three character classic and do an exercise with this in class.

**Overview:**

* In this class we will attempt to understand the impact of the Chinese revolution on other movements around the world, both in the developed world, and in countries as distant as Nepal and Peru. We will consider how aspects of the cultural revolution in particular were attractive, but also how the broader approach of the Chinese revolution offered an alternative radical path for revolutionaries. We will attempt to identify certain patterns in various places but also appreciate local translations of Maoist ideas.
