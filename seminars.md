## Seminars

## Week 1 - Introduction: Revolution and History in China, 1911 and 1949

**Preparation:**

* Our module is not a general survey of Chinese history but will focus in on the history of its revolutions. While you will get some general background video clips on Chinese history (see below) from week to week, I suggest you purchase an introductory survey text on modern Chinese history to read as the course goes along. A few of the most popular survey texts include:
    * Jonathan Spence, *The Search for Modern China* (old, longer work, but still used as textbook in most courses on modern China)
	* Diana Lary *China’s Republic* (short, interesting mix of materials)
	* Patricia Ebrey, *Cambridge Illustrated History of China* (if you want something that covers pre-modern period as well)
	* Rana Mitter, *A Bitter Revolution* (we’ll read parts of this, more episodic and character based with a narrower argumentative narrative)
	* Karl, Rebecca E. *Mao Zedong and China in the Twentieth-Century World: A Concise History* (this has less on the pre-1949 period)
* Memorise the basic chronology in the student handbook up to 1927. Look up 2 of these events online and read a bit about them. Be prepared to say something you find interesting or curious about them.
* Write down 2-3 things about revolution that you know, or alternatively, things that you are hoping to learn about
* Each week you will be asked to watch a few clips from the Harvard China X online history course that, while often available from general textbooks, can be a fun visual way to get background information on the week’s topics. This first week, please watch the following clips: 
    * China X: Learn the (Major) [Dynasty Song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2sF8tgmREPo#t=140) and be prepared to sing it in class. 
    * China X: Watch the [Historical Overview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XupdENYui-Y) for the 20th Century
    * China X: Whatch the [Space and Place](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5aqgxVuHCvc#t=13) video.
    * China X: Watch [Physical Geography](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwsqKYHIYvU#t=10)
    * China X: Watch [Ethnicity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZhYQz6D_bM)
    * China X: Watch [Language](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SmP9iuK9NWw)
    * China X: Watch [Written Language](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5Hh-P-plF8)
* Look up William C. Kirby, Peter K. Bol and Mark C. Elliot. What kinds of history do each of these scholars do? They will be in a number of video clips from China X that we will use as a basic introduction to some background in the course.
* ChinaX WorldMap: Visit and browse the spatial data layers for Qing, Republic, and People's Republic on the [China X WorldMap](http://worldmap.harvard.edu/maps/chinaX) (Turn off the pre-Qing layers for a clearer look). Use this map throughout the semester to help orient you in your reading.
* Be ready to sick the dynasty song from the link above!
* For Week 2 we will read the entirety of Henrietta Harrison's *The Man Awakened from Dreams: One Man's Life in a North China Village, 1857-1942*, consider ordering your own copy or getting a head start to avoid a rush for the short loan copy.

**Overview:**

* China, some of the basics
* Discuss: What things do you already know about the Chinese revolution, what do you want to know about?
* Task: We will sing the dynasty song together
* What this course will cover and not cover
* Why revolutions in plural, 1911 and 1949, and the long/plural Communist revolutions in China?
* Getting to know the course:
    * The long essay as focus for semester efforts: start thinking about it now
    * Strategies for reading and preparation in this course
    * Our shared notes document
    * How presentations work
* If Time: Discuss events you looked up and some of the aspects of them you found interesting.

* Decide which week you would like to give a presentation and choose a backup week just in case
* Decide which two additional weeks you want to be a text guide
* Look over the seminar topics for the remaining weeks of the semester. Pick two or three topics that especially interesting to you for the long essay. Be ready to discuss them in class.

* Discuss: focus on Harrison and the experience of change.

**Questions for discussion:**

1. What factors leading to Qing decline suggest they might pose challenges for 20th century regimes as well?
2. What changes in the later Qing dynasty that were likely to be most felt from the perspective of individuals outside of the larger cities?

**Long Essay Ideas:**

* The 19th century or late Qing period is a critical period to examine the broader structural changes to Chinese society. Exploring some aspect of these changes in a place or a particular moment and its longer legacy and consequences could be interesting.
* Sources from this period include a large number of primary sources in English from travellers to China, missionaries, and those with economic ties. These sources have their limitations but they may also yield interesting new perspectives.

**Films of Interest:**

* Raise the Red Lantern (大红灯笼高高挂 1991) - set in 1920s but captures the insularity of the domestic experience for many 
* Fairwell My Concubine (霸王别姬 1993) - also 20th century but again, captures the breadth of transformations
* To Live (活着 1994) - a third movie that gives a full sweep

\newpage

## Week 3 - Rebellions as History, Myth, and Inspiration

**Preparation:**

* In addition to the main readings choose one of the following large political upheavals and be prepared to say something about its particular characteristics, causes, longer legacy: Boxer Rebellion (1899-1900), Taiping Rebellion (1850-1864), Nian Rebellion (1852-1868), Panthay Rebellion (1856-1873), the Eight Trigrams Uprising (1813) or White Lotus Rebellion (1796-1804)
* Review the pronunciation and romanisation section of this handbook, and visit a website or online video or two to practice some of the main sounds for Chinese. This can help you pronounce names and places throughout the course with greater confidence.
* The reading for this week is especially light. Take advantage of this time to complete your first long essay

**Overview:**

* Task: Map quiz, we'll do it again!
* Discuss: Will examine the primary sources closely and then discuss Cohen and Perry readings
* Reviewing formation of analytical arguments for essays
* Check in with everyone on progress forming a topic for long essay

**Questions:**

1. In what ways did environmental factors, and their man-made contributing aspects impact the rebellions of the late Qing?
2. If the rebellions of the late Qing have provided powerful material for 20th century revolutionary movements, what aspects of them are less useful? That is, what process of forgetting might be required?

**Long Essay Ideas:**

* Notice that neither of the past two weeks have included much of anything on the Opium Wars. In any standard narrative of modern China that war plays a very powerful role in the narrative and for some, the founding event of modern Chinese history. Like the Boxer and Taiping Rebellions it is also a moment that is looked back upon again and again in later periods for inspiration and for its key role in the rise of anti-imperialist and later nationalist ideas in China. Students are welcome to focus in on some aspect of the Opium Wars for their long essay.
* The rebellions of the 19th century and the later histories and myths of these rebellions are rich ground for exploration. For those who cannot read Chinese, there are also many primary sources with outsider perspectives on some of these events that may suggest interesting ways to approach these periods.
* The political and economic tumult of this period is also interesting material for comparative long essays that look at connections and contrasts between the great rebellions, for example, and those found elsewhere in the world.

**Films of Interest:**

* 55 Days at Peking (1963) - How are the Chinese portrayed in this film?
* Boxer Rebellion (八國聯軍 8-allied countries, 1975) - Kung Fu movie and almost inverted version of 55 Days at Peking
* Warlords (投名狀 2007) - Action movie set during Taiping Rebellion but has little to do with it

\newpage 

## Week 4 - What Sort of Revolution destroyed the Qing Dynasty in 1911?

**Preparation:**

* The reading for this week is again light. Do some more preliminary research on your potential long essay topic as the first short essay is due soon. What kinds of primary sources are out there for your area of interest (unless you are doing a historiographical essay) in languages you can work with? What kinds of historical scholarship has been done? 
* Come to class with a well-formed idea for your long essay and your first short essay if it was a prospectus so we can share ideas with each other and get feedback.

**Further Reading:**

* Cambridge History of China v11, 463-534 (Ch 9 Republican Revolutionary Movement)
* Esherick, Reform and Revolution in China: the 1911 Revolution in Hunan and Hubei
* Rankin, Early Chinese Revolutionaries

**Overview:**

* Long essay topics and discussion on them.
* Discussion on essay types, historiographical, primary source driven
* Discussing the balance between narration and analysis in writing argumentative historical essays
* Focus of discussion will be on late Qing reformers, and visions of what it meant to be "Chinese" and the emergence of a modern Chinese nation and identity.

**Questions:**

1. In what sense was 1911 a revolution? Or, if you prefer, why does it not deserve the name?
2. In what way do visions of what a post-Qing republic by intellectuals differ from the Nationalist and Communist political orders to come?
3. What kind of legacies did the revolution have and what lost opportunities were there?

**Long Essay Topics:**

* As we have seen, this period is filed with rich discussions about what China was to become. There are also a significant number of translated texts on the vibrant intellectual life in the late Qing Dynasty, as well as English language primary sources on the turbulent period from period of the early republic. Long essays that focus in on one of these visions of what China should become, the perspectives of one Chinese intellectual, or what hopes and fears outside observers had for what China was to become are possible topics. 
* 1911 gave rise to a deeply chaotic period during which it is even harder than usual to generalise about changes across China. Consider exploring this early post-1911 period or the "warlord period" more broadly at the regional level.
* Japan, individual Japanese figures, and Chinese in Japan played an important role in the late Qing period, during the 1911 revolution and in the aftermath. There are many aspects of this relationship which are worth examining more closely.

**Films of Interest:**

* 1911 (2011) - An pretty awful movie with Jackie Chan
* Xinhai Revolution (辛亥革命 - 2011) - Chinese TV miniseries on the revolution in 41 parts.
* The Soong Sisters (宋家皇朝 1997)

**Further Reading:**

* Mitter, Bitter Revolution - rest of book
* Spence, Gate of Heavenly Peace
* Chow, The May Fourth Movement
* Smith, Like Cattle and Horses, 92-115 (Ch 5 The May Fourth Movement)
* Grieder, Hu Shih and the Chinese Renaissance
* Schwarcz, The Chinese Englightenment: Intellectuals and the Legacy of the May Fourth Movement
* Wang, Women in the Chinese Enlightenment

**Overview:**

* Our discussion will be divided between a concentrated look at the primary sources from the New Culture Movement and thinking about how May 4th continues to be something that is repeatedly looked back to in a way that 1911 is not.

**Long Essay Ideas:**

* The new culture movement is an exciting transformative period. In addition to the many new debates being carried out among youth and students within Japan there are many Chinese increasingly active abroad. Focusing in on some aspect of the internationally based Chinese can be an interesting focus for an essay.
* This period overlaps with intense competition among various Western powers and Japan for control in China which will intensify anti-imperialism around China
* This is the period of the formation of the Communist Party in China and a period of far greater diversity of ideas and vision both within the party and among revolutionaries of various kinds. Focusing in on some aspect of this for a long essay can make use of a rich secondary literature and availability of translations of early Communist leaders.
* There are lots of interesting comparisons to be made between the May 4th Movement and movements elsewhere. The work of Erez Manela on the "Wilsonian Moment" can give you some ideas both for this week, and broader ideas for transnational long essays throughout the essay.

**Questions:**

1. What are the longer term legacies of the May fourth movement?
2. What are the ways that culture and politics are intertwined in this period?
3. We read three works by Mao Zedong from the same month in 1939 on May 4th. How do these texts differ in terms of how Mao is deploying a revolutionary movement of 1919?

**Films of Interest:**

* My Early Days in France (我的法兰西岁月 2012)
* My 1919 (我的1919 1999)

## Week 6 - Building Revolution and the War with Japan, 1931-1945

**Preparation:**

* Begin work on your second short essay. Time management is important this week and next especially.
* Refine your long essay topic and progress with your reading for it. 
* The reading is quite heavy this week. Try not to get bogged down in the details of local case studies - you can skim over those details. Instead keep your eye open for how these authors contest eachothers' general arguments about the role of the wartime period on the rise of the Communist party and its later success in taking power. Make yourself good notes comparing what are sometimes subtle, sometimes very blunt differences in emphasis, agency, use of sources, and forms of evidence.

**Reading (~230):**

* SOURCES, 396-450 (Ch 34-35 Communist Revolution, Communist Praxis)

* Read all but two of the following introductions to these works. Then choose one of them, based on what you found interesting, and read a bit more in depth (1-3 chapters) in one of these texts and be ready to talk about it in class. Consider sharing your notes from your in depth reading on our collaborative notes document:
    * Zarrow, China in War and Revolution, 271-288, 295-303 (Ch 14, part of Ch 15)
    * Goodman, North China at War, 1-18 (Explaining Revolution)

    * Wou, Mobilizing the Masses, 1-19 (Introduction)

**Further Reading:**

* Consider completing one of Selden, Johnson, Kataoka, Wou, Chen, or Gatu
* Mitter, China's War with Japan
* Lary, The Chinese People at War
* Etō, Hai-Lu-Feng: The First Chinese Soviet Government, 43-98 - an earlier example

**Overview:**

* A brief check-in with all of you on how your long essay research is progresing, giving you a chance to share discoveries
* We will focus in on debates over what impact the war had for the prospects of the Communist Party. 

**Questions:**

1. In the debates over the relevance of the second Sino-Japanese war on the rise of the Communist party, evaluate the claims of two historians whose arguments can be said to significantly contradict one another.

2. What is one way that regional differences matter in discussing the impact of the second Sino-Japanese war on the rise of the Communist party during this period?

**Long Essay Ideas:**

* This is one of the most active areas of research on modern Chinese history. While the war itself does not have a huge amount of scholarship compared to its impact, as you saw this week the historiography on the connection of the war to CCP growth and later success is massive. You might consider wading into this debate in some modest way, perhaps with a focus on a particular case, place, or specific aspect of the argument. 
* If the historiography is heavily on the CCP, exploring the role of the war on the nationalist party might also be worth exploring.
* Many international visitors came to China or went from China to other parts of the world and commented on the conflict. Primary sources related to this are more accessible if you don't read Chinese and can offer some interesting perspectives.
* Again here there are rich opportunities for comparative studies or looking at influences and interactions across borders.

**Further Reading:**

* Hinton, Fanshen: A Documentary of Revolution in a Chinese Village 
* Dikötter, finish Tragedy of Liberation 
* Dikötter, finish Mao's Great Famine

**Overview:**

* This seminar covers a lot of ground. An entire course could easily be given on this period of China's history itself, from the wartime repression of the Rectification movement, the civil war with the GMD from 1945-9, the early postwar Land Reform movement, China's involvement in the Korean War and the rise of anti-Americanism, the Hundred Flowers campaign and the anti-Rightist campaign that followed, and perhaps most importantly: the great famine of the Great Leap Forward, which is only rivalled by the Sino-Japanese war in terms of its devastation to the Chinese population.
* Our focus in the discussion will not be on the details of this or that campaign, but on better understanding the patters of how these campaigns were carried out, eahc of which various led to the deaths of thousands or hundreds of thousands of Chinese, and why the Great Leap famine rose above them all with its death toll in the millions.

**Long Essay Ideas:**

* This is also a very dark period in Chinese history and more difficult to explore without the ability to read Chinese primary sources. However, those of you interested in economic history have a lot of possibilities to explore the economic aspects of the great famine and the commune system, and there are also possibilities to explore this period from a comparative perspective. 
* From an international perspective it might be interesting to explore how this period was depicted abroad at the time with a close case study. 

**Questions:**

1. Do what degree do the severity of the various political campaigns have to do with individual action versus structural factors?
2. Why was the Great Leap famine unusually devastating?

**Films of Interest:**

* To Live (活着 1994)
* The Blue Kite (蓝风筝 1993）

**Questions:**

1. How does the Cultural Revolution differ from the many political campaigns that preceded it?
2. What are the longer term legacies of the Cultural Revolution?

**Overview:**

* In this class we will attempt to understand the impact of the Chinese revolution on other movements around the world, both in the developed world, and in countries as distant as Nepal and Peru. We will consider how aspects of the cultural revolution in particular were attractive, but also how the broader approach of the Chinese revolution offered an alternative radical path for revolutionaries. We will attempt to identify certain patterns in various places but also appreciate local translations of Maoist ideas.

**Questions:**

1. What does it mean to call a movement "Maoist"?
2. What accounts for the sheer variety of Maoist or Maoist inspired movements in the world? How did they differ?

* Today we attempt to expose some of the problems of doing a module such as this with its central focus on "revolutions" rather than a national narrative, or indeed, other themes such as environment, culture, and gender. 

**Questions:**

1. How does a straightforward historical narrative of the Chinese revolution make it difficult to confront the history of gender or environment in a Chinese context?

2. Why does revolutionary culture matter in studying the Cultural Revolution?

* Vogel, Deng Xiaoping and the Transformation of China

**Overview:**

* Today we conclude the course with a consideration of a critical turning point in Chinese history, a moment when China shifted from a period of general opening and reform, to one which sacrificed any serious political reform in exchange for stability and economic development. 
* We will divide the discussion into two parts: First trying to understand the protests themselves, and then considering them in the much longer history of youth, politics, and mass movements in the history of Chinese revolutions. Then we will shift to thinking about the legacies of the massacre, and how it plays a crucial role in engagement with China today.

**Questions:**

1. How does "The Gate of Heavenly Peace" help transform the way we think about the Tian'anmen protests? About mass protest movements in general?
2. The Chinese government, and many Chinese will claim that the blood of Tian'anmen was a price to pay in order to avert political chaos that would have resulted in far more violence. What logic and assumptions are at work here? What happens when we generalise these claims to other places and times?
