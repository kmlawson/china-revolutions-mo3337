## Seminars

## Week 1 - Introduction: Rebellion and Revolution

**Preparation:**

* Moodle: Using the module Moodle "Presentation Signup" wiki, sign up for a week to do a presentation on one of the 10 weeks from 2-11. Choose a week with a theme you are interested in but have a backup in case you don't get your first choice. We will revisit this in class if you have any problems.
* Our module is not a general survey of Chinese history but will focus in on the history of its revolutions. While you will get some general background video clips on Chinese history (see below) from week to week, I suggest you purchase an introductory survey text on modern Chinese history to read as the module goes along. A few of the most popular survey texts include:
    * Jonathan Spence, *The Search for Modern China* (old, longer work, but still used as textbook in most courses on modern China) - [library ebook](http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/CBO9781139167253)
	* Diana Lary *China’s Republic* (short, interesting mix of materials)
	* Patricia Ebrey, *Cambridge Illustrated History of China* (if you want something that covers pre-modern period as well)
	* Rana Mitter, *A Bitter Revolution* (we’ll read parts of this, more episodic and character based with a narrower argumentative narrative) - [library ebook](http://www.myilibrary.com/?id=75235)
	* Karl, Rebecca E. *Mao Zedong and China in the Twentieth-Century World: A Concise History* (this has less on the pre-1949 period)
* Memorise the basic chronology in the student handbook up to 1927. Look up 2 of these events online and read a bit about them. Be prepared to say something you find interesting or curious about them.
* Write down 2-3 things about revolution that you know, or alternatively, things that you are hoping to learn about
* Most weeks you will be asked to watch a few clips from the Harvard China X online history course that, while often available from general textbooks, can be a fun visual way to get background information on the week’s topics. This first week, please watch the following clips:
    * China X: Learn the (Major) [Dynasty Song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2sF8tgmREPo#t=140) and be prepared to sing it in class.
    * China X: Watch the [Historical Overview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XupdENYui-Y) for the 20th Century
    * China X: Whatch the [Space and Place](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5aqgxVuHCvc#t=13) video.
    * China X: Watch [Physical Geography](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwsqKYHIYvU#t=10)
    * China X: Watch [Ethnicity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZhYQz6D_bM)
    * China X: Watch [Language](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SmP9iuK9NWw)
    * China X: Watch [Written Language](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5Hh-P-plF8)
* Look up William C. Kirby, Peter K. Bol and Mark C. Elliot. What kinds of history do each of these scholars do? They will be in a number of video clips from China X that we will use as a basic introduction to some background in the course.
* ChinaX WorldMap: Visit and browse the spatial data layers for Qing, Republic, and People's Republic on the [China X WorldMap](http://worldmap.harvard.edu/maps/chinaX) (Turn off the pre-Qing layers for a clearer look). Use this map throughout the semester to help orient you in your reading.
* Be ready to sing the dynasty song from the link above!

**Overview:**

* Short Lecture: China, some of the basics, 19th century background to 20th century developments
  * We will return to the pre-1911 period in Weeks 7 and 10.
* Discuss: What things do you already know about the Chinese revolution, what do you want to know about?
* Task: We will sing the dynasty song together
* What this course will cover and not cover
* Why revolutions in plural, 1911 and 1949, and the long/plural Communist revolutions in China?
* Getting to know the course:
    * The long essay as focus for semester efforts: start thinking about it now!
    * Strategies for reading and preparation in this course
    * Our shared notes document
    * How presentations work
* If Time: Discuss events you looked up and some of the aspects of them you found interesting.

**Long Essay Topics:**

* The late Qing dynasty was a period of great tumult. There were a large number of western missionaries and merchants in China during this time, however, who have left behind their papers, memoirs, and other records. This includes many from Scotland. As these primary sources are in English and other European languages, those without the ability to read East Asian languages can make use of these rich sources to explore this period.
* Some of the great rebellions provide rich terrain for comparative study, or transnational study. For example, some of the American soldiers sent to join the repression of the Boxer movement were fresh from crushing revolution in the Philippines and Haiti. Look for some of the many interesting international connections to explore
* Works published before 1923 can be found in great quantities on Archive.org, making this a great place to explore publications about China that can serve as primary sources if published near the time.

## Week 2 - From 1911 to May Fourth

**Preparation:**

* Start your research for your long essay!
* Moodle: Post one or two or three ideas for your long essay to the Moodle in the form of a few sentences, and bring two printed copies to class for discussion. (By Class start)
* Begin your reading with Rana Mitter's overview in *Bitter Revolution* as it will help you make sense of the rest of it.
* The reading is relatively heavy this week, please give the primary sources a close look over and don't forget to bring them to class
* Have a look at these posters from post-1949: [May 4 Posters Landsberger Collection](http://chineseposters.net/themes/may-fourth-movement.php)

**Overview:**

* Our discussion will be focused mostly on the the primary sources from the New Culture Movement with very brief discussion on historiography of 1911
* Long essay topics and discussion on them.
* Discussion on essay types, historiographical, primary source driven
* Discussing the balance between narration and analysis in writing argumentative historical essays

**Questions:**

1. In what sense was 1911 a revolution? Or, if you prefer, why does it not deserve the name?
2. What kind of legacies did the revolution have and what lost opportunities were there?
3. What are the longer term legacies of the May fourth movement?
4. What are the ways that culture and politics are intertwined in this period?

**Long Essay Topics:**

* 1911 gave rise to a deeply chaotic period during which it is even harder than usual to generalise about changes across China. Consider exploring this early post-1911 period or the "warlord period" more broadly at the regional level.
* Japan, individual Japanese figures, and Chinese in Japan played an important role in the late Qing period, during the 1911 revolution and in the aftermath. There are many aspects of this relationship which are worth examining more closely.
* The new culture movement is an exciting transformative period. In addition to the many new debates being carried out among youth and students within Japan there are many Chinese increasingly active abroad. Focusing in on some aspect of the internationally based Chinese can be an interesting focus for an essay.
* This period overlaps with intense competition among various Western powers and Japan for control in China which will intensify anti-imperialism around China
* This is the period of the formation of the Communist Party in China and a period of far greater diversity of ideas and vision both within the party and among revolutionaries of various kinds. Focusing in on some aspect of this for a long essay can make use of a rich secondary literature and availability of translations of early Communist leaders.
* There are lots of interesting comparisons to be made between the May 4th Movement and movements elsewhere. The work of Erez Manela on the "Wilsonian Moment" can give you some ideas both for this week, and broader ideas for transnational long essays throughout the essay.

## Week 3 - Building Revolution and the War with Japan, 1931-1945

**Preparation:**

* Moodle: Post a Research Diary entry on the Moodle Forum. See the Moodle for the format of this diary entry. Then post a constructive comment on at least one other student's post. (Entry by Tuesday Morning, Comment by Thursday)
* Refine your long essay topics and evaluate them for feasibility of sources and interesting possible approaches. If you already have a topic, then continue reviewing the historiography not only directly on your place, event, people, or organisation, but historiography related to the theme that may not be China specific. What are key texts on this theme generally (for any place in the world)?
* For the reading today and generally, try not to get bogged down in the details of local case studies - you can skim over those details. Instead keep your eye open for how these authors contest eachothers' general arguments about the role of the wartime period on the rise of the Communist party and its later success in taking power. Make yourself good notes comparing what are sometimes subtle, sometimes very blunt differences in emphasis, agency, use of sources, and forms of evidence.

**Overview:**

* A brief check-in with all of you on how your long essay research is progressing, giving you a chance to share discoveries
* We will focus on the primary sources but also discuss a bit some of the differing interpretations of the war's role in the rise of the CCP

**Questions:**

1. In the debates over the relevance of the second Sino-Japanese war on the rise of the Communist party, evaluate the claims of two historians whose arguments can be said to significantly contradict one another.
2. What is one way that regional differences matter in discussing the impact of the second Sino-Japanese war on the rise of the Communist party during this period?
3. What patterns do you see in the language and style of Mao and Liu's writing?
4. What does "democracy" mean for the Communist Party?
5. What is the party's approach to the public exchange of ideas, art, and literature? How is the view justified?

**Long Essay Ideas:**

* This is one of the most active areas of research on modern Chinese history. While the war itself does not have a huge amount of scholarship compared to its impact, as you saw this week the historiography on the connection of the war to CCP growth and later success is massive. You might consider wading into this debate in some modest way, perhaps with a focus on a particular case, place, or specific aspect of the argument.
* If the historiography is heavily on the CCP, exploring the role of the war on the nationalist party might also be worth exploring.
* Many international visitors came to China or went from China to other parts of the world and commented on the conflict. Primary sources related to this are more accessible if you don't read Chinese and can offer some interesting perspectives.
* Again here there are rich opportunities for comparative studies or looking at influences and interactions across borders.

## Week 4 - Great Leaps Forward: Violence and Reform 1945-1961

**Preparation:**

* Moodle: Please consider posting a copy of your prospectus to the Moodle forum. There you are required to give a constructive comment on at least one other student's prospectus.
* This week brings us from the campaigns around the time of liberation to the end of the Great Leap Forward. My own previous research has included a focus on "anti-treason" campaigns of the mid-1940s against accused collaborators (among others) which overlap somewhat with a wartime "rent and interest reduction campaign" and preparations for the massive and important land reform campaign after Japanese defeat. The land reform campaigns, much of it carried under civil war conditions, was a hugely important and in many places extremely popular campaign that was often looked back upon as the greatest achievement of the Chinese communist party, despite the murder of over a million people in its implementation. The "Great Terror" (Campaign to Suppress Counterrevolutionaries) beginning 1950 may have resulted in the murder of around two million people and was the most concentrated period of political killings in the history of the CCP (The Cultural Revolution impacted a much larger number of people over a longer period of time but is a far more complex event and most likely a smaller aggregate number of victims).
* The "Hundred Flowers" campaign and the repression that followed in its wake is one of the more debated and unusual moments in CCP history but while we have read a bit on this for today, it will not occupy much of our class discussion.
* The Dikötter reading is narrative with small pages, rather than heavy analytical material so should be a smooth easy read.
* You also have your short essay coming due. Please make enough time to get through it.
* Clips on the Hundred Flowers Movement and repression that followed:

**Overview:**

* We will devote most of our class time to discussing our readings on the Great Leap Forward and its associated famine, which had a devastating impact on China, leading to tens of millions of victims, mostly from starvation.

**Long Essay Ideas:**

* This is also a very dark period in Chinese history and more difficult to explore without the ability to read Chinese primary sources. However, those of you interested in economic history have a lot of possibilities to explore the economic aspects of the great famine (including the role of Chinese exports in this period) and the commune system, and there are also possibilities to explore this period from a comparative perspective.
* There are a range of personal memoirs and accounts that include this period that can form the basis of a student essay.
* From an international perspective it might be interesting to explore how this period was depicted abroad at the time with a close case study.

**Questions:**

1. Do what degree do the severity of the various political campaigns have to do with individual action versus structural factors?
2. Why was the Great Leap famine unusually devastating?

## Week 5 - The Cultural Revolution

**Preparation:**

* Moodle: Post a Research Diary entry on the Moodle Forum. See the Moodle for the format of this diary entry. Then post a constructive comment on at least one other student's post. (Entry by Tuesday Morning, Comment by Thursday)
* Watch *Morning Sun* (2003) - 2 Hour Documentary by Carma Hinton. It is available in the library reference area. Consider scheduling a time to watch it together with 2-3 classmates. The fact the DVD was in use the day before class is not an appropriate excuse for not having watched the documentary. Plan ahead. Take notes and be ready to discuss the documentary. This film is considered fair game for the final exam.
* Look through these posters related to the Cultural Revolution by browsing the following page, and then the various pages for individual campaigns 1966-1976:
    * Chineseposters.net: [https://chineseposters.net/themes/cultural-revolution-campaigns.php](https://chineseposters.net/themes/cultural-revolution-campaigns.php)
* Please use this week to make serious progress on developing your ideas for the long essay.

**Overview:**

* We'll learn a few Chinese phrases popular among young revolutionaries
* We will discuss how one might talk about several cultural revolutions that call for entirely different historical approaches: the focus on a political campaign carried out by Mao that MacFarquhar emphasises; the experience of its violence by its victims; the campaign to send youth to the villages; a localised political transformation; an emancipatory breathe of fresh air for those who participated actively; a period of cultural devastation for China; the way that all of these have come to be remembered.

**Questions:**

1. How does the Cultural Revolution differ from the many political campaigns that preceded it?
2. What are the longer term legacies of the Cultural Revolution?

**Long Essays:**

The cultural revolution is one of the most fascinating periods of PRC history. There are many published accounts, visual sources, documentary collections (The *Not a Dinner Party* collection by Schoenhals is one important one) and literary materials that can form the basis of a student essay.

**Overview:**

* Today we conclude the chronological half of the course with a consideration of a critical turning point in Chinese history, a moment when China shifted from a period of general opening and reform, to one which sacrificed any serious political reform in exchange for stability and economic development.
* We will divide the discussion into two parts: First trying to understand the protests themselves, and then considering them in the much longer history of youth, politics, and mass movements in the history of Chinese revolutions. Then we will shift to thinking about the legacies of the massacre, and how it plays a crucial role in engagement with China today.

**Questions:**

1. How does *The Gate of Heavenly Peace* help transform the way we think about the Tiananmen protests? About mass protest movements in general?
2. The Chinese government, and many Chinese will claim that the blood of Tiananmen was a price to pay in order to avert political chaos that would have resulted in far more violence. What logic and assumptions are at work here? What happens when we generalise these claims to other places and times?

**Overview:**

* In this class we will attempt to understand the impact of the Chinese revolution on other movements around the world, both in the developed world, and in countries as distant as Nepal and Peru. We will consider how aspects of the cultural revolution in particular were attractive, but also how the broader approach of the Chinese revolution offered an alternative radical path for revolutionaries. We will attempt to identify certain patterns in various places but also appreciate local translations of Maoist ideas.

**Questions:**

1. What does it mean to call a movement "Maoist"?
2. What accounts for the sheer variety of Maoist or Maoist inspired movements in the world? How did they differ?

* Task: We will also discuss the three character classic and do an exercise with this in class.
